  If you want to learn about the author's feelings and musings about modern society cloaked in the history of our species, this book is for you. If, however, you, as I did, want to learn something scientific about the progress of our species unspoiled by a political screed, search for something else. Rarely have I felt that I misspent money on a book. In this case, I did. Too bad because it might have been an interesting read. I could go on, but it's not worth more of my time.

  I bought the book based on high rating but was disappointed. The beginning part was ok but later I felt more and more not reading actual (scientific) facts but only the author's own opinions REPEATEDLY which were presented in a bad way. I tried to continue to finish the book but it was not an easy task. Anyway, not a good book for me,

  The book starts ok, with a useful compilation of recent scientific discoveries. Then Dr. Harari begins to introduce sensationalist claims, like: “A corporation is a myth,” then proposes evidence that fits his claim. A corporation is not a myth, it’s a legal entity created by humans to conduct business with other humans. If a corporation is a myth, then the constitution of USA, and any other set of laws must be a myth as well.Ho goes so far as to declare that America, or any other country is a myth! Come on… Tell this to a pack of wolves who call their territory Wolfland.For me, Harari is one of those authors who come up with sensationalist and outrageous claims in order to sell his book, and judging by the ratings, he largely succeeds. But so do fake news.So, Harari goes on to attempt to tear down just about every human institution of the last few thousand years as being fictional or ""imaginary"". Well, sure, they were all invented by humans. But invention is not fiction. Neither it is a myth.Starting with a conclusion and only proposing evidence that fits with said conclusion bored me and I stopped reading it about a quarter of the way through.I really gave it a try, but this book is one of the most pretentious and pompous books I've ever read.I love good clear authors. Harari is not one of them. Can hardly get through a paragraph of his without being irritated by his generalization without support, constant non-sequiters and presentation of opinion as fact. And when he feels he’s gone too far, he says “Most scientists agree.” Go check it out.

  Bill Gates, Barrack Obama, and Mark Zuckerberg all love this half baked postmodern, neo Heglian, neo Marxist, reductionist, animal rightist, hodge podge?  The author is smart and knows how to turn a phrase, but announces Truth from Olympus while dismissing others' world views as myths. Evidently the only thing he does not know about is the self referential paradox. Everyone but the author lives in a myth. He will tell us the real Story, as though his story is not a myth. One thing I am sure of, 100 years from now no one will remember this book was ever written.

  Harari primarily presents an hypothesis as to how Homo sapiens who successfully migrated out of Africa circa 70 kya (thousand years ago) and thereafter, successfully dominating the planet, differed from earlier Homo sapiens who attempted out migration previously (e.g. around 130 kya) but were not successful.  Keep in mind that Homo neanderthals in Europe and Homo erectus in Asia had climate and environment adaptations that sapiens did not have and were separate species.  Harari claims (assumes) that the later sapiens differed from the earlier sapiens in only one way.  They had evolved the ability to form an ""inter-subjective reality,"" as opposed to objective reality (physical) or subjective reality (in only one person's mind).  They were able to tell stories and believe them, independent of physical reality.Everything from myth to religion to nations to moral codes to money are inter-subjective realities according to Harari.  They have force in the physical world as long as people believe them, and cease to exist the moment people no longer believe them.  This explains how people could cooperate in groups larger than 150, giving them a military and security advantage, and encouraging specialization which eventually gave them a technological advantage.Moreover, Harari claims (assumes) all these later sapiens were genetically identical, and that the variations in societies are purely cultural, i.e. inter-subjective realities.  He presents history as an erratic evolution toward global unity, which is essentially demanded by the nature of inter-subjective realities, requiring belief of all those in mutual frequent contact, but he doesn't say how.In fact, Harari presents only anecdotal evidence for his claim.  He presents no empirical studies regarding the flexibility of humans toward inter-subjective realities, and no mathematical models of its development, evolutionary advantage, or stability.  He describes the scientific method as an important development, and requires it to include both mathematical models and verification of them.  But he does not use either in his treatise.  Thus he presents an important and interesting hypothesis, but not in a scientific manner.  He makes not even suggestions as to how to further formulate or verify it as a scientific theory.  Perhaps he is trapped in the inter-subjective reality of history as liberal arts, not science.The term ""intersubjective"" does exist in the literature of psychology and philosophy, primarily as a synonym for ""agreement,"" but there is no agreement about its definition (Gillespie and Cornish 2009, Journal for Theory of Social Behavior) state:""The  concept  of  intersubjectivity  is  used  widely,  but  with  varying  meanings.  Broadly  speaking,  we  take  intersubjectivity  to  refer  to  the  variety  of  possible relations between people’s perspectives. If we take social life to be founded on interactions  then  intersubjectivity  should  be  a  core  concept  for  the  social  sciences  in  general  and  understanding  social  behaviour  in  particular.  Perhaps because  of  this  broad  relevancy  research  has  been  fragmented  and  at  least  six definitions are in circulation. Most simplistically, intersubjectivity has been usedto  refer  to  agreement  in  the  sense  of  having  a  shared  definition  of  an  object.""The biggest complaint I have about Harari is that he does not distinguish between his opinion and facts, nor explain the background of how he arrived at the theory of inter-subjectivity.  The study of the evolution of cooperation is a hot topic, with political scientists, biologists, mathematicians and even physicists all having theories, and much data collected and many math models developed.  It is apparent Harari is aware of this, but does not tell us how his theory fits in.  I can only conclude he finds his powers of popular persuasion greater than his powers of scientific persuasion and critical analysis, so he writes a long book instead of a focused research paper.By the way, you can find excellent video summaries and reviews of this book on the web, and even a ""summary"" for sale as an eBook.  I originally got interested from the video summary.Near the end Harari reports on happiness research.  In this section of the book he takes exception to his usual approach, giving us descriptions of studies and names of researchers so we can trace where these conclusions come from.  The book is worth reading for this section.Occasionally Harari gets facts wrong.  You won't realize this unless you have investigated the matter separately.  I noticed it because his description of the origin of the caste system in India was wrong, according to current research.Harari tries to present himself as outside modern factions (or inter-subjective realities), such as nature vs. nurture, liberalism vs. conservatism, etc.  But without conscious explication, he suffuses his book with the assumption that any modern human if taken from birth is equally at home in any of the current or historical inter-subjective realities.  He does not propose or even consider experiments to determine culture-vs-genetics.  So he proposes this important genetic ability evolved in a small population on a single continent between 130kya and 70kya, but that no differentiating evolution has occurred since then.The question of whether the degree or style of inter-subjectivity is as universal as he implies is important for several reasons.  Harari proposes the world is ""different"" since 1945, with no war between major powers, no more empires expanding by territorial acquisition.  He suggests some reasons for this (cost of nuclear war, for example) which are unverified.  His book was completed in 2014 before Russia claimed parts of Ukraine and China claimed the entire South China Sea.  If inter-subjective capacity is universal, then this situation is likely unstable.  People could quit believing it at any moment, and the world could return to any state that it has been in historically.  If inter-subjective capacity is not identical in everyone, then it might make a great deal of difference which cultures dominate, even if through historical accident.  See for example Boyd and Richerson 2009 Culture and the Evolution of Human Cooperation.So, it is a book full of powerful ideas, often with carefully balanced arguments on both sides, but beware of accepting the background assumptions without critical thinking, or you will just fall into the latest meme.

  I don't do book reviews too often.  But this was definitely one of the most important books I've ever read.  For me it was a massive shift in perspective that cleared up a lot of confusion I had about history and our strange modern life.  The thesis is simple and profound; Q:  What makes Homo Sapiens so different from the rest of the animal kingdom, and why are we so dominant?  A:  Our ability to create and share our Fictions; ""the Inter-Subjective Realm.""  I had studied many different philosophies over the years but I had never heard of this phrase, the ""Inter-subjective Realm.""  And now, it is staring me in the face as obvious.  I've heard similar references about 'artificial worlds' or 'hyper-realities', but usually these things are characterized as a distraction or a kind of human malfunction (i.e. kids addiction to video games).  Harari demonstrates in a convincing way that it is our Fictions...and our ability to share them, that give us immense power in nature.  It is clearly this ability which sets us apart from the other animals.  Many mammals can flexibly cooperate in small numbers through intimate acquaintances (say up to the Dunbar number, think of Chimps and Wolves).  With this ability these small bands can adapt to changing group politics and to new environmental challenges.  On the opposite end of the spectrum, some species can cooperate in huge numbers through hard-wired instincts (i.e. think of ants, or migratory or co-evolutionary species).  Those species can do amazing things with their large numbers of individuals but they cannot adapt quickly to change as their behavior is 'hard-wired', only modified through eons of natural selection.  However us humans can do both; we can flexibly cooperate in small or unlimited numbers, and in unprecedented ways.  The mechanism behind this is our Fictions; which provide us the ability to communicate, simulate, plan, coordinate, and adapt in unlimited numbers.  It is our Fictions that allow us to exceed the creative and manpower limits of modest numbers.  Our Fictions are a kind of Software that we can use to rapidly adapt to the world around us.  We can march in huge armies for a united cause for a monarch, then turn around and have a revolution which overthrows the King who launched the movement.So what are these Fictions?  They are our Languages, our Gods, our Nations, our Corporations, and much more.  Money is a kind of shared Fiction that establishes trust.  Brands and Companies are fictional inventions, and so are religious or philosophical ideologies and idols.  Our most cherished rituals and beliefs that we assume to be 'true' are the most powerful of all our Fictions.  Fictions allow us to not only speak the same language, but to share the same customs, beliefs, and rituals.  They allow us to follow the same laws & customs, to share strategies, and even swap dreams.  So a devout Catholic can travel to Europe for the 1st time and meet another devout Catholic who is a stranger, yet instantly they can collaborate on an important project.  Muslims could do the same with each other, as could employees of Volkswagen, or fans of the New England Patriots who have never met.  Despite having no intimate acquaintance, they can meet for the 1st time and feel kinship.  They can collaborate via their titles, beliefs, rituals, and procedures.  Fictions allow us to specialize and to diversify in amazing ways.  A scientist who studies the water cycle, a hydrologist, a structural engineer, a builder and a politician can come together to create a dam (something beyond any single person's reach).  In this doing this, they can alter the course of major rivers, a capability which was formerly the exclusive domain of the Gods of Old.  We can even work together to build a ship that travels to the Moon, something WAY beyond the imagination of the ancients who wrote our 'Holy' books.Our Fictions are not only our means to achieve power in nature, they are also the embodiment of our power in the real world.  Indeed it is legal fictions like Gods and Nations and Companies...not individuals, that have the true power and influence in the real world.  Even when an individual appears powerful or famous...its not the physical person per se with whom the power resides.  In truth it is the 'Celebrity', the brand, or the LLC.  Even the author of Sapiens is not working right now to achieve a book sale on Amazon.  His likeness, his celebrity, his ideas and his copyright are doing the real work.  That's also how an Elvis who has been dead for 40 years can still sell $70 million worth of merchandise in 2017, and his Estate can buy property, hire employees and feed his decedents.  That's a pretty impressive feat for a (long since) dead guy!  With this understanding of Fictions in mind, suddenly this crazy world actually makes a bit of sense.  Seemly disparate things: bureaucracy, religions, Celebrity worship, LLC's, people's addiction to Facebook, the immersive quality of stories and movies, even Idealism itself...it's all related to our Fictions. Our technologies also feed this passion and ability for shared imaginings.  First with the invention of writing which allowed for accounting, bureaucracy, and the creation of laws, commandments, and legends.  Then came an extension of those abilities with photos and films, TV and movies, and more recently the internet and social media.  So what's to come?  I'd guess immersive environments, gamification, shared realities, and interactive collaboration.  But the real technology then and now has always been our ability to imagine and embody our ideas into shared Fictions.

  Any history of Homo Sapiens would be a colossal undertaking.  Unfortunately, this book isn't it.The good news:The book started off as a captivating discussion of the development and rise of our species. It reminded me that Homo Erectus spent a million years using stone tools but went no further. That Neanderthals disappeared in Europe when Homo Sapiens arrived. And at least for me, a fresh set of insights about the Agricultural Revolution - it was an accident, we can't go back, and if it hadn't happened we'd lack anything we call civilization.Some other provocative assertions were worth pondering. Humans are nothing more than animals with ideas. Ideas are lies we tell ourselves. And that humans unite when they shared delusions - whether it's religions, nationalism, or sports teams.  Also, our entire economic system - money, capitalism, et al, is another delusion that requires our faith in order to survive.The bad news:It's not a history - it's ""Pop History."" Superficial with lots of bold assertions without any corroborating evidence. With five minutes on Google you can discover that some of the most outlandish stories are false (i.e. the Apollo astronauts encounter with the Navajo Indians.)  If you thought Joseph Campbell's ""Hero With a Thousand Faces"" was based on real research you'll love this book. Much like Campbell Harari has given us an opinion piece disguised as a ""history of humankind"".The book can be generously called a set of personal meditations of history and human nature, but done with little research and even scanter evidence.  If it had been labeled such I might have approached the second half of the book differently.

  I don't know what Bill Gates and Barack Obama saw in this book, but what I encountered is neither history, nor evolutionary psychology, nor really anything worthwhile. What I encountered was  a very long progressive political screed.The Kindle sample is misleading, and makes it appear as if the book might be interesting. It's not.I really should have known better when Harari asserted that humans were probably happier as hunter-gatherers. I thought, ""would I want to be a hunter-gatherer?"" Uh, no, not so much.Harari then goes on to attempt to tear down just about every human institution of the last few thousand years as being fictional or ""imaginary"". Well, sure, they were all invented by humans. But that doesn't make them prima facie ""bad"" ideas. In Harari's world, though, they're all suspect.If you're unlucky enough to have already bought this book, call Amazon for a refund. I did.

  Never before have I reviewed a book after 2300 others have done the same.  Who's going to read 2300 reviews and who will read this?  Surely a waste of time for a lot of people including me.  Now that I am past that let me state that Harari gives a heckeva good read.  This is not the usual rise and fall of empires and kingdoms but a broad ranging overview of how we got here.  Parts of it were downright fascinating such as ""imagination"" being a keystone to human activity, e.g. corporations, money, and religion.Something I found really different and pleasing was his discussion of things where he had no real answer.  In the case of all cultures being patriarchal he gives three or four possible reasons.  That's good enough for me as there is still no real answer.  I find that fair and enlightening.  He also does something different as he uses the pronoun ""she"" throughout the book instead of the previously required male pronoun.  Finally he keeps touching on the fact that animals have paid a terrible price for the rise of sapiens.  From hunter-gatherer days to the factory farms of today they have suffered.  He's right.  Incidentally our family has a farm background and I eat no chicken, turkey, pork, or beef.  Ever been in a confinement barn?Now I didn't give the book five stars because he makes positive references to the misguided but widely read Jared Diamond.  He borrows a fair amount from Diamond, for example, in that hunter-gatherers were happier than folks today.  Let me emphasize that on this snowy March day the cat and I are both glad we don't need to go out and scavenge something off the frozen earth.Finally, beware of the paper back edition.  It has incredibly cheap paper and tiny print.  If you purchase the book look for a hard cover.  I now consign this review to oblivion. . .still I liked the book.

  “Tolerance is not a Sapiens trademark.”Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, by Yuval Noah Harari is one of the most entertaining and informative books I’ve read in a long time. It usually takes me longer to get through nonfiction than fiction, but I blew through this book despite it being a bit of a tome. In fact I didn’t even notice how long it was until I saw the paper version later. It’s that accessible and so much fun to read.I learned so much about history, social culture, and the human race from Sapiens. For instance, this following idea blew me away: gossip, not physical strength or military cunning, is what makes leaders and binds communities and nations. It seems we developed language just to talk about each other, not for trade or power or more.I loved how Mr. Harari the word “fiction” (aka common myths) to describe the concepts that let large numbers of strangers cooperate across space and time: “There are no gods in the universe, no nations, no money, no human rights, no laws, and no justice outside the common imagination of human beings.” This is kind of terrifying, but also quite true if you stop to think about it.I also found it darkly amusing and irreverent how he talks about philosophies and hate groups and religions and economic models, all in the same breath: “Some religions, such as Christianity and Nazism, have killed millions out of burning hatred… Capitalism has killed millions out of cold indifference coupled with greed.”I got a crash course in mega fauna, those giant animals that existed on earth for thousands of years until humans killed them off in a matter of decades: the giant diprotodon, a 2.5 ton wombat, dragon-like lizards, snakes seven feet long, a 450 pound six foot kangaroo, a marsupial lion as massive as the modern tiger, a flightless elephant bird, ten feet tall and half a ton (the largest bird in the world), and the giant lemur (earth’s largest primate).“Don’t believe our ancestors lived in harmony with nature. Homo sapiens hold the record among all organisms for driving the most plant and animal species to their extinctions. We have dubious distinction of being the deadliest species in the annals of biology.”Mr. Harari trashes the Agricultural Revolution: “This is the essence of the Agricultural Revolution: the ability to keep more people alive under worse conditions.” Nor does he spare the Scientific Revolution: “The Scientific Revolution and modern imperialism were inseparable.” Naturally, religion doesn’t stand a chance, especially the monotheist ones of today which are described as far more fanatical and missionary than the more tolerant open-minded polytheist religions of old. Only Buddhism seems to get a bit of a pass.Each concept and chapter of human history is explained with compelling examples, from economics to history to biology to psychology and so on. In some ways, it seems we’re heading forward, with less violence than ever before, new forms of consciousness, life continuing as we could not imagine it, but continuing all the same. For e.g., Mr. Harari explains that ecological degradation is not the same as resource scarcity, and that in fact, our resources (solar and wind power, man made materials, etc) are constantly increasing, and are likely to continue to do so. The environment on the other hand…But in more ways, Sapiens is an indictment. It is undeniable that “a significant proportion of humanity’s cultural achievements owe their existence to the exploitation of conquered populations,” that “there is no justice in history” and that perhaps happiness is the act of “synchronizing one’s personal delusions of meaning with the prevailing collective delusions.”The parts about animal husbandry are incendiary. From age old practices to modern slaughterhouses, “tens of billions of animals have been subjected to a regime of industrial exploitation whose cruelty has no precedent in the annals of planet Earth. If we accept a mere tenth of what animal rights activists are claiming, then modern industrial agriculture might well be the greatest crime in history.” The descriptions of some of these practices are chilling, perhaps enough to persuade you towards vegetarianism.I found it strangely comforting, in these bad sad days of war and terrorism and misogyny and hatred, to be reminded that this phase we’re in where we work as urban labourers and office workers has only lasted a couple hundred years. The 10,000 years before that, we were farmers and herders, and even that is a vanishing second compared to the tens of thousands of years of human hunters and gatherers. We have a long way to go and much more to learn. And anyway, the nihilists have always known that “from a purely scientific viewpoint, human life has absolutely no meaning.”If you’re tender about things like religion, capitalism, or even human rights, Sapiens won’t give you a break. But it is one rollicking relevant read.

  I was impressed by Sapiens.  I have read some books that cover some of the same material.  For example, books by Jared Diamond, Nicholas Wade, and Jacob Bronowski.  Of those three authors it is the closest in ambition to Bronowski's Ascent of Man back from the 1970's, except it is significantly better.  I thought the book almost merged into moral and political philosophy because it was subtly giving you analytical tools to judge culture.  For example the book states all large societies use great myths (religion, countries, moral codes, money, financial institutions, family institutions) to generate the social cohesion to make large societies function.  But can we judge one more or less moral than another?  I think the answer implies the answer is yes and implies some criteria.It not only merges into moral philosophy but it also merges into the realms of religion replacing religion with science.  That is not uncommon, but when you get a sharp thinker and writer like Harari it is much more convincing.Maybe my biggest fault with the book is that it reaffirmed by own biases too much so it is hard for me to tell if the reasoning is as good as I think it is or whether the reasoning only seems really good because its reaffirming my own biases.  For example I became a vegetarian in my early 20's for moral reasons (I didn't like the way animals were treated).  I felt like the author agreed with me.  In the end I felt like the author just a slightly smarter version of myself who gave me better arguments to substantiate the beliefs I already have so I have a natural bias for this book.Also how did this book get over 3000 reviews?  Seriously!  It is well argued and interesting, but its not a polemic designed to enflame one side and laud another side so I have no idea how 3000 people were motivated enough to write a review.

  I was verrrrrrrry disappointed in parts of this book.  It starts out well-- the overview of human-prehistory is quite decent, and I learned some new things, esp. about human impacts on biodiversity.  (full disclosure: I'm a scholar in an overlapping field, with an MA in History of Science in an Israeli university, with many colleagues who have also worked with this author).  As with many authors in the Richard Dawkins style of popular writing, he oversteps with determinism around evolution and how it works.  Unlike many authors, he does accurately recognize that the agricultural revolution was at least partly a disaster, and continues to be, ecologically... But where it really lost me was in his capsule history of economics.  He's clearly out of his expertise here, parroting uncritically the barter-as-founding-myth-of-economics, which has been conclusively debunked, there are zero anthropolgists on the planet who would agree that 'everyone was doing barter, it was a pain, so we created money'.  For that whole aspect of his narrative, one would be far better off reading David Graeber's 'Debt: the First 5000 Years'.  This book is very ambitious, and I admire his chutzpah in attempting so all-encompassing.  If you're interested in world history and humanity's future, it's worth a read, but with a big grain of salt.

  I thought this book would be about anthropology and evolution; I would learn how homo sapiens went from the tools and ability to survive 100,000 years ago to where we are now. The emphasis in this book, though, is generally on the capacity of homo sapiens (humans) for exploitation and destruction. This capacity appears to be endless. If that topic is one you want to read about, this could be a good book. If instead you want to learn about anthropology and evolution, this would not be the best choice.

  Page 3:”The Scientific Revolution, which got underway only 500 years ago, may well end history and start something completely different.” Presumably, he is referring to Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo (each in the 16th century CE—Newton lived in the 17th century CE), ignoring that heliocentricity was first proposed Aristarchus (3rd century BCE), as quoted by Archimedes in the 2nd century BCE (mathematician, physicist, engineer, famous for calculating pi, law of floating bodies, exponentiation,  early calculus, and a variety rigorous mathematical proofs). Nor is he aware that in the 2nd century BCE Erathostanes determined, within 10%, the circumference of the earth, using the geometry of similar, right triangles deriving from the work of Pathagorus (5th century BCE). From Kepler’s calculations of planetary orbits and with Galeleo’s invention of the telescope, Roemer (17th century CE) determined the speed of light using Io’s emergence from an eclipse by Jupiter.  From Newton’s mechanics of inertia, Einstein (20th century CE) deduced that mass was equivalent to energy (E=MC2). The points are (a) that human, motivation, imagination and ingenuity to understand the universe in these “mind problems” are far more magnificent than stick figure paintings in caves; (b) that modern science arises from the unique ability of sapiens to transmit information across millennia [Isaac Newton: “If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.”]. Harari does not seem to appreciate these remarkable phenomena unique to sapiens, one involving language, another other endless curiosity—the two integrated by logical reasoning, well beyond the simple need for survival of the hunter-gatherer. Only at the end of this interminable book do we get explanation of the vacuous, “may well end history and start something completely different”; i.e. brain inplants, cyborgs, genetic modifications, and some other ethically dubious things. In concert with today’s, American, political left, Harari cites the Declaration of independence disdainfully: [“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”] First, he argues that we have not achieved the ideal of [economic] equality. But no society, whether capitalist or communist (for example, today’s China) has ever achieved economic equality The Declaration of Independence was a political, not philosophical or economic, document, written by colonists, some of whom were not English and by others who were English but anti-establishment (viz., the Puritans), all disaffected under the rule of a remote, English monarch. As a political document, this was an extension of the English Magna Carta (13 century CE) which held that even the king had some limits under the rule of law; but the Declaration went beyond this to say that all men, even the king, were equal under the law. It is self evident, throughout the history of mankind, that individuals are not created equal in ability, and, as a result, there never can be equal achievement/outcome. The Hebrew scriptures (starting at 1200 BC) depict unusually gifted heroes chosen by God, often miraculously (thus symbolically chosen) born from barren women or under other difficulties—i.e. Isaac, Joseph, Moses, Samuel, Sampson); or chosen by God when already in the womb (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Paul of Tarsus). The Christians similarly adopted the doctrine of God’s elect, because life’s experiences clearly define a gradation of gifts/talents among individuals that are independent of affluence, privilege or heritage (for example, the Hebrew King, David—farmer, mercenary soldier, adulterer, murderer, psalmist, military and political genius, God’s chosen one). In this same section, the author does a riff on “happiness”, inappropriately defining it as pleasure (i.e., a temporary hedonic response to a defined stimulus); but 300 pages later, he, more appropriately, defines happiness as [long term] contentment with life, then argues that such a sentiment is a [religious] delusion. Yet we all know people from various backgrounds (whether they are religious, agnostic, or atheistic) who are happy and not evidently deluded. So herewith we see the author’s pervasive inconsistency, cynicism, and bias. He disdains the Agricultural Revolution (because of the “enslaving” toils of plowing, planting, and harvesting, and the anxieties of crop failures) and the Industrial Revolution (thinking of the poor coal miners in the dank, dark coal mines). But the agricultural revolution ensured a more predictable food supply, thus assuring a stable growth of population (and with it, more geniuses); while the Industrial Revolution, aside from improving standards of living, begat the growth of the English middle class and, with it, a more democratic polity. His pessimism persists for the present day, claiming that we are enslaved by our affluence (longer life span, better health, better nutrition, more leisure because of serial inventions, more time and money for R&D). This attitude is a repetition of the early 18th century reaction to rapid progress during the Enlightenment, expressed as an admiration of, or pining for, the “noble savage” (aka the hunter-gatherer). It was nonsensical then and is nonsensical now. He makes the dubious claim that the world of sapiens has become more peaceful than ever for fear of nuclear Armageddon [“Robert Oppenheimer should have been given the Nobel Peace Prize (for his management of the Manhattan Project)”]. Yet, since it’s founding in 1949, his Israel (a covert nuclear power) has fought three wars and still is under frequent missile bombardment from the Palestinians. The Unites States (a pre-eminent, overt nuclear power) has been almost continuously at [undeclared] war since 1950 [Korea, Viet Nam, Lebanon, Somalia, Granada, Iraq (twice), Kosovo, Libya , Afghanistan (and covertly Yemen)]. Since their separation in 1946, India and Pakistan (now both overt nuclear powers) have fought each other three times and continue to threaten war with each other. In the last section of the book, he correctly recounts the progress made with artificial limbs, some controllable by brain impulses. He also refers to the recent use in China of CRISPER technology to edit a gene in a human embryo, suggesting that we are already on the road to creating super-humans. Yet this rogue experiment has been internationally condemned because no one knows how such a manipulation may affect future generations of humans. As a race, we are not ready to go down this road. So what’s to like in this book???

  A reader unfamiliar with the author's specialty will find little disagreeable about this book at first blush, other than its suspicious aversion to citation. Even where that is concerned, expert authors have done worse when writing for a general audience.But the sheer range of of the text, so glibly and didactically presented, gnaws at the reader before long. This is not a sum of knowledge that can be honestly presented by a single man without reference to experts in the many fields on which he touches, and indeed, it is not honestly presented -- at least, not by the standard of serious scholars. It's pop junk masquerading as something more authoritative, and its acclaim comes from reviewers too lazy or credulous to know the difference.

He uses twisted logic to explain why good is bad and bad is good and then uses these same terms to characterize things he is for or  against.

  This author never met a nuance he cared to explore. As a result, the text varies from unengaging to downright silly. It attempts to address a variety of scientific fields but fails totally, most because he seems not to understand the scientific process. One of my favorite lines: ""This couldn't be a coincidence."" Well, yes, in the scientific process two events can be entirely coincidental. This must be a possibility until proof of a connection is found.

  An entertaining read and good source for summer cocktail party chat, hence my two-star rating.Harari’s broad brush – or rather, paint roller – approach inevitably skips over much potentially relevant detail. This is understandable, but distorting facts to support his arguments or seemingly merely to be cute is unacceptable. It also undercuts his credibility.For example, Harari’s discussion of the dissolution of the Soviet Union includes the following.“When its members [the Soviet and Eastern European Communist elite] realized that Communism was bankrupt, they renounced force, admitted their failure, packed their suitcases and went home.”The Soviet elite hardly went home with their tails between their legs. In Russia, Boris Yeltsin was a former Politburo member and his hand-picked successor Putin came from the KGB. In Kazakhstan, the Soviet era ruler Nursultan Nazarbayev became President. Similarly, Kyrgyzstan’s first President Askar Akayev had been a deputy in the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. These are just a few of the obvious examples.This book is a good beach read but as substantive as cotton candy.

  Why do we read history? Winston Churchill said “The farther back you can look, the farther forward you are likely to see.” How about looking back 13.5 billion years ago when we were primordial soup? Yuval Noah Harari’s Sapiens takes you on a journey from the beginning of time.Sapiens traces our species through the last 100,000 years and the Cognitive, Agricultural, Scientific, and Industrial Revolutions. Harari speaks of Communism, Capitalism, Democracy, Liberalism, Christianity and Islam etc. as if they are all religions. Brilliant! We all have to believe in some abstract concept such as equality or liberty to get us through the day. Harai demonstrates how even paper money and banking lending regulations are a bit of a sham. But belief in all these myths have fueled growth and progress. Harari argues that storytelling and dreaming is what sets us apart from all the other animals. They have enabled mankind to farm, build the pyramids, chart the globe, defy gravity, and split the atom.After the 100,000 year journey is the Homo sapiens species any happier? Harai says it depends on how you define happiness. All of man’s tremendous advances have come with some dire consequences but the biologist would have to compare the dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin levels of modern man vs the hunter gather. The answer is we are probably not any happier.If you read Sapiens will you achieve total consciousness? Probably not but Sapiens will broaden your horizons and expand your perspective of man's journey to present day. Plus it will provide you with great stories to bother your coworkers with during coffee breaks and long car rides. You can also highlight key passages to read them to your wife while she is trying to watch HGTV. All of Harai’s theories seem reasonable and are backed up with several examples. More importantly Sapiens is presented in a manner that is upbeat and anything but boring.Have you ever considered buying a ticket to India so you could climb to the top of the mountain to ask the mountain top guru about the meaning of life? You may be able to save yourself a 3000$ plane ticket and spare yourself from eating curry if you go out and buy a copy Harari’s Sapiens. If you do go to India look over the great Carnac's shoulder I’ll bet you find a copy of Sapiens levitating on his book shelf.

  There is a lot here to like in terms of the latest details in DNA discovery and key archeology  finds.  I think that the author has some interesting thoughts about early human culture and the drivers that led to agriculture and civilization.  That being said, I agree with many of the reviews that criticize the author's left wing political bias- particularly his tendency to state a theory as fact, and then to use that ""fact"" as basis for a another hypothesis.  In all fairness, this is a work that his meant for the layman and not an academic audience- so I found it worthwhile, but he could have made it much better by not often sounding like an entitled 24 year old (I believe he was almost 40 when he wrote it)

  Some parts are great, others not so great. His attempts to show how racism, sexism, and homophobia are figments of our imagination with no scientific backing are fine, but it's preaching to the choir for most of us. And that's always boring. Almost wondered if he wanted to earn some PC brownie points.Also he says multiple times that ""evolution has no purpose"". This is a roundabout way of throwing rocks at organized religion--science's arch enemy for hundreds of years. Scientists like Darwin uncovered something truly miraculous yet they all seem too dull minded to see it! Genes and organisms modifying themselves to best suit their environments? Doing so without any conscious will on the part of the animal? How is this not a purpose in itself? Plants learned how to use the sun as an energy source millions of years ago and invented photosynthesis without taking a single Botany 101 class. You're telling me this isn't a miracle? Not a purpose? Nature itself seems to be driven by an ivisible will to survive and thrive.I'm not saying this proves God--as defined in the Hebrew Bible or the Koran or the Upanishads--is behind all of this. But to say it's all random and meaningless? I don't get that. Most scientists seem like existential philosophers who imposes their somewhat gloomy worldview onto the facts. This is one reason why so many people retreat back to religion. Sometimes you just want to hear a happier song! Even if it's built on pretty lies so often. Science is a wondrous story with a lot of killjoys for storytellers

  Please do not be put off by the inside material looking somewhat like a textbook or that the near-450-page paperback surprisingly weighs as much as a bloody hippopotamus. Mr. Harari's writing is highly entertaining and informative. It's nowhere near as dry as most textbooks. There are colorful photos and a handful of diagrams scattered throughout the book. ‘Sapiens’ is written in a jaunty factual manner that’s very much grounded in the sciences, but it is easy to follow along with the author’s explanations.Creationists’ heads will likely explode or they’ll be itching for a good ole fashion book burnin’ after reading the first few pages of ‘Sapiens.’ Magical thinking is only presented when Mr. Harari discusses how and why religions developed. The material is placed into factual information, educated guesses, or grey areas. It covers four key developments in the evolution of Homo sapiens: the Cognitive Revolution (70,000 years ago), The Agricultural Revolution (12,000 years ago), the Scientific Revolution (1500 AD), and the Industrial Revolution.  Mr. Harari also addresses the good and bad aspects in each of these areas. The author plays an impartial observer. ‘Sapiens’ explains such things as the importance of myths and gossip, social orders, polytheistic and monotheistic religions, dualism, natural law religions, the invention of money, romantic consumerism, the invention of writing and mathematics, empires, capitalism, Communism, and how we are globally much less warlike than at any time in history. Mr. Harari also weaves together the necessary marriage between science, the military, and capitalism. The book was published in 2011 in Israel, yet, his chapter ‘Imagined Communities’ inadvertently explains the near-mindless tribalism occurring in our current politics. ‘Sapiens’ concludes with the hypothetical, metaphysical, and ethical challenges humans will face as we continue to evolve. The three-page Q&A with the author, inserted after the book’s index, was also quite interesting.Most of ‘Sapiens’ is an enjoyable read with a few topics that made my stomach hurt. The process of industrializing farm animals for food, how we are rapidly driving others species to extinction, and what we have done to people based upon our religious beliefs or capitalism are the three subjects that come to mind. I learned a lot from the book and it also left me with a lot to think about. Mr. Harari next book, ‘Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow,’ will most certainly be on my reading list in the near future. The dude makes learning fun.

  The first third of the book talking about our primate and neolithic heritage has some fascinating insights, including an excellent description about how widespread sharing of narrative myths aid cooperation, even if the myths are bunkum (eg., religion). But as soon as Harari caught up with modern history it was nothing but Vox quality drive-by opinionating, along with attempts to eat his cake and have it to when it comes to the author’s abject failure to subject these opinions to a rationally consistent value system. (Factory farming is animal slavery: Chickens and cows have manipulated man into unwittingly becoming their slaves. Life was better and people where happier when we were tribal hunter gatherers: Government supported science has delivered an unimaginably wonderful standard of living.) But this is typical of people who can hold contradictory ideas in their heads without discomfort. Hariri’s lack of understanding about how entrepreneurship and engineering drive science and not the other way around is a common error, since that’s what the Big Science Industrial Complex keeps feeding us so all those academic scientists can stay on the dole. And his description of capitalist economics and fractional reserve banking is an outright disaster, particularly his confusion that because you can create money out of thin air this means you can magically consume assets that have not yet been produced. But I can see what made the book so popular with new age, vegan, central planning, government-school indoctrinated ninnies. The guy is a very good writer. Which is a pity.

  This is the “cookbook” (reference from the movie Lady in the Water where M. Night’s character played by himself writes this book that will change the consciousness of humanity).  The author has reached nirvana, an enlightened being that felt compelled to express his deep thoughts in a book for all to listen and read.  He has touched and tasted the true nature, understands non-duality, understands everything is empty and an illusion.  He expressed his spiritual journey not in the first 5 chapter of the book outlining pure evolution, but thereafter decided to get all spiritual and all-mighty with his Buddhist ways and provide his perception on reality.I imagine the writer feels the homosapiens that give him a 1 or 2 star review are moaning and groaning over his viewpoints that lean more progressive, but I’m a progressive and open-minded individual myself and that isn’t why he gets a 2-star rating.  He gets a 2-star rating for his excessive writing on a barrage of topics that are based on his intuitive opinions.  I respect his convictions on many topics, but I didn’t buy the book to get this author’s sometimes pessimistic take on humanity, I was under the guise I would be reading a book on humanity from a purely scientific and academia perspective.  Instead I get an author that loves animals, thinks everything is a myth, and  loves using the word “Buddhism”.  We get it, you subscribe to Buddhism.  Congrats.

  Mr Harari presents a broad sweep of history placing events in juxtaposition and implying causal connection that is not clearly demonstrated. His concept of myth is useful but judgment about which myths are better in some ways belies his thesis that all are neutral and equal. He is critical in his evaluation of religious bodies but leaves out Judaism until, in his next storial developments ook he includes it because he got so many letters about it. He presents his ideas as if they are original discoveries of his, such as plants using people to propagate themselves, but Michael Pollin popularized that notion years ago. He makes much of how capitalism changed everything without taking into account the multiple other historical developments surrounding its inception. He presents a future of technology replacing humans but does not account for ways in which humans might eventually derail that. The end notes are simply too few to make this a seriously scholarly work. We are left with much speculation but little to help us more deeply understand the development of our species. It makes for a rousing speech but in the end it does not satisfy.

  There is great deal positive that can be said about this sweeping history of the human species on Earth. Dr. Harari homes in on key factors of human development such as the impact of economic systems, the building of empires, and the spread of religion.  His brief descriptions of different philosophies and religious concepts and his explanations of why some have been more successful than others are highly enlightening.  He points out many areas of conflict and contradiction in present society.  In one insightful statement he identifies an escalating conflict between liberal humanism and evolutionary humanism (biology), which is coming even more to the forefront with the advent of sophisticated tools for genetic modification.Yet, the reader is frequently reminded that Dr. Harari is an historian and not a scientist and that sapiens are not his favorite species.  Some long sections are little more than sermonizing about his pet peeves with the current world order:  Western Racism and mistreatment of animals.  His long diatribes about rampant racism are aimed exclusively at Europe and the US.  He fails to make any mention of the significant minorities in his own country who claim to have been explicitly disenfranchised, an omission that smacks of hypocrisy.  And despite pages and pages of editorializing about the supposedly terrible way domestic animals are treated today, he fails to provide any real evidence that treatment of animals has become worse today than it was in past, or that this is a uniquely human flaw.  On the contrary, it is easy to find many first-hand accounts of chimps, dolphins, and cats interacting with other species in a manner that clearly fits the definition of torture.With an allusion to another of Dr. Harari’s pet peeves, the agricultural revolution, Sapiens contains a lot of wheat, but the reader also needs to separate out the chaff.

  Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari is quite extensive in its scope despite the sub-title.  Harari covers the entire history of the species he calls Sapiens, from their unexceptional rise in Africa to their domination, and ultimate transformation of the world.Harari is so inclusive that he often runs two lines of thought without trying to rectify them.  He stresses, quite correctly, that human evolution and dominance of the planet was an accident, and is by no means secure. But in other areas, he writes as if it is the destiny of Sapiens to grow more complex in their social arrangements; that it is fated.He juggles these two balls throughout the book.  The author often treats Sapiens as animals, no more special than any others.  At other times, he presents Sapiens as destined creatures, so unique that they will surpass natural selection entirely with intelligence and technology.This has been the cleavage that runs through our species self-conception since the rise of natural science.  In this book, the two streams can be a bit distracting, even annoying at times.  But Harari is presenting a work that is vast in its scope and aims; in a way, it seems fair to leave this part of the human experience unanswered and contradictory.  In the end it is the best approach to examine the history of our troubled species.

  Prof. Harari’s (Hebrew University of Jerusalem) book certainly has sweep, if nothing else. He starts at the dawn of creation, taken to be 13.5 billion years ago, and moves quickly to the appearance of genus Homo on this fleck of a planet, at 2.5 million years. His rather arbitrary starting point is the appearance of deliberately-manufactured stone tools, found at archeological sites independently dated from nuclear decay rates. He identifies at least three major human species, Erectus, Neanderthalensis, and our own, Sapiens, which have since evolved. Of these only Sapiens remains, N. having died out about 30,000 years ago.  Some minor species have come and gone, but have apparently left only modest, regional traces behind.Then, about 12,000 years ago, what Dr. Harari calls the Agricultural Revolution began. The Sapiens population, ever increasing, went from nomadic bands of hunter-gatherers to settled communities centered around predictable sources of food. Animals and plants were domesticated, the hunting bands became tribes, and the tribes settled down to become farmers. With this of course came the need for some sort of administrative machinery, and all of the elements of what we call civilization began to develop.Now, within the last 500 years, our species has taken another turn. This is what Dr. Harari calls the Scientific Revolution, followed and augmented by the Industrial Revolution, which we are still experiencing. We have seen an explosive increase in Sapiens’ power and capabilities, including the power to self-destruct, and we are by no means in control of this new dynamic. Dr. Harari provides some thoughtful speculations as to our future, but of course no prescriptions. He is after all simply recounting the past.This is a calm, reasonable book which will doubtless fuel many troubling fantasies, especially those experienced in the darkling hours before dawn; read and be chilled. Five stars.

  ""Sapiens"" ought to be on every college (or even high school) curriculum. The subtitle, ""A Brief History of Humankind,"" does NOT mean that it isn't very deep and very, very intense. Anyone interested in learning how the world works, and why it works the way it does, needs to read this. Giving it an honest read -- put aside all your cognitive biases about everything -- will open your eyes, and free your mind so that you can think critically. Since ""Sapiens"" is a book of actual ""facts,"" some readers in this ""post-truth"" world might have a hard time swallowing it. Anyone finding this book difficult to read probably doesn't understand what ""facts"" and ""evidence"" are. These days, the line between facts and opinions very nearly doesn't exist. This book draws a hard and desperately needed line between the two.

  It's really hard to argue with anything in Yuval Harari's ""Sapiens"" which is the ultimate reason I gave it five stars. I am sure he is correct that humanity is now one civilization run by a multiethnic Westernized elite, despite the occasional war and resurgent dictatorships. The surge in the last few years in nationalistic populism is more a reflection of people's impotent rage against this situation than any long-term reversal thereof. The decline in democracy is not a victory of the non-West over the West, it represents capitalism displacing democracy now that the former has recognized the latter as a threat. This forces me into the camp that Harari would describe as socialist humanist, without whose efforts the liberal humanist camp cannot survive either.Harari himself is in Diogenes' camp: he is a cynic. This stems from his knowledge that all political and religious and most social ""knowledge"" is actually just myths we agreed on so society could function and grow more complex. (We can know actual facts about people in our immediate circles and indeed could not function at all were this not true.) Diogenes, although only briefly referenced on page 112, comes across as basically the only great thinker Harari is willing to emulate.The speculations on the future with which Harari ends the book were so good that I wish there were more of them. I don't want to spoil the surprise for anyone who might be inspired to pick up the book. Suffice to say that humanism is likely to become obsolete itself in the near future.My favorite part of the book is chapter 11, ""Imperial Visions,"" as I like to study empires. In this chapter you can find Harari's analysis of his own country, Israel, which ends with an amusing take on what King David might think of Jerusalem if he came across a modern ultra-Orthodox synagogue.  We see here something Harari does throughout the book -- the gentle poking of fun at modern man and our self-importance. Modernity indeed separates us from every previous generation. This separation threatens to widen into an unbridgeable chasm for which there really are no solutions. I give this book five stars.

  I have read several books similar to what this book pretended to be. Each of them have their own interesting topics and ideas. This book was just a bizarre collection of the author's opinions about random things throughout history. The agricultural revolution was a scam? I made it about 30% of the way through before I had to give up. Skimming through i saw that the rest was just random musings about strange ideas the author had, and really nothing about what it promised to be.

  This book, while had a great and fascinating start took the wrong turn from a book about Sapiens and their history to a book of opinions about trivial problems with religions and even the modern take on Gender and homosexuality. I wanted a book to have actual research and science on the journey of man from African onwards and explore where humans settled and how they lived. He did a little of that before jumping into an illogical word-splurge on why 2 genders is really a mistake because times change and the word 'women' can have different roles now as humans. His explanation on homosexuality was laughable and devoid of any solid psychology. Taking an evolutionary look on homosexuality is simply not the same as giving a motive for homosexuality based on population size. That's not what or why homo sapiens have homosexuals nor would this type of science qualify for the complex explanation.  He also brings together context on the Earth itself during its many climate changes but then still suggests the climate crisis is happening today. How does this compute? He has listed and seen massive amounts of changes the Earth has undergone and yet by any comparison of today's climate humans are far better off and concludes its a crisis. This does more to tell us about how ignorant humans have become and think than it does the history of Sapiens. I want history, I want science, I want maps, pictures, citations and findings. This was opinion based on assumed research. This was a personal conclusion to the actual archaeology and science that comes pre-interpreted. I didn't ask for that.

  This book was interesting and thought provoking but often frustrating to read. The author has tried to keep up to date with recent scholarship but he spends a lot of electrons (I read it on a Kindle) on speculative things, and avoids some of the politically incorrect facts that have recently come to light. That's why I gave it only 4 stars. It might be helpful to remember that myth and history originally meant essentially the same thing in ancient Greek, ""Story."" That's what this book is, but it's an interesting story with lots of helpful ideas if you don't take it as fact..I bought it because I'd already learned (through a PBS documentary) that new evidence of proto-human DNA in non-African humans has come to light. Therefore, scholars now believe there was interbreeding between the first ""anatomically modern"" humans (apparently the term ""Cro-Magnon"" is no longer used) and Neanderthals in Europe on the one hand, and what used to be called ""Peking Man"" or Homo Erectus in Asia on the other. This means the races of mankind are a little more different in their biological heritage than just skin color and hair texture. Anyone who has lived with purebred dogs knows that within a species, there can be very great differences in behavior and ""personality"". I was curious to see what today's scholars think about the biological differences between humans and their relationship to racial stereotypes. The author dismisses that with one sentence and a flat refusal to consider it a possibility.He tantalizes readers with a ""Cognitive Revolution"" that suddenly gave Homo Sapiens an advantage over the other apes in our genus and triggered their extinction. Yet he doesn't explain what exactly became different in Sapiens's brain that caused that. It is known (from what they buried with the dead) that Neanderthals believed in an after-life and that they felt grief when they lost a tribe member. It is known that they cared for the sick and injured because of the condition of their bones. Indeed, whenever there's a new discovery in anthropology it seems to place the Neanderthal much closer to being human than I was taught in school. So what's that cognitive difference? What does it come from? Can it be located in the genome, or do we have to rely on a traditional notion like ""God gave Sapiens a soul?"" Of course the author would despise that explanation but he gives us nothing better, indeed, too little in this section of the book.Likewise, he gives us too much on medical progress and the plausibility of an eventual conquest of human mortality. The creation of an ""amortal"" human, a being like an elf in Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings,"" does not seem to me a possible outcome in the near future, and contrary to what the author says, science fiction writers have already explored the possibility of ""amortality"" and found it wanting. Had the author read ""Time Enough for Love"" by Robert Heinlein (1973), he would have realized that such a development has numerous psychological pitfalls and might not be worth pursuing. J.R.R. Tolkien had already realized earlier that if you're much longer lived than the people you care about, eventually they all die and you just can't stand it any more. So, I felt that section of the book was just pie in the sky silliness.While the notion that the Neolithic Revolution (he calls it the Agricultural Revolution but I’m sticking to the terms I learned as an archaeology major in college) might have made the individual’s lot more difficult is interesting and thought-provoking (and might well be true!), other claims about history ring rather hollow. As the co-owner of a horse farm in my old age, who has shared his accommodations with dogs and cats most of his life, I can declare without the slightest doubt that domestic animals often lead pampered and loved lives, far better than they could manage in the wild, waited on by humans who feed them, treat them when they’re sick, and clean up after them. It simply isn’t true that modern man abuses the other animals – well, at least not all of them.Finally, there's a conceptual problem with the entire work. While the author hammers home the point repeatedly that human societies work because of shared beliefs (like money or religion) for which there is no proof, he fails to recognize that science, too, is a religion. It's based on a shared belief of which there is no proof, the existence of ""natural laws"" -- notions that Plato and Aristotle would recognize. For those who haven't quite figured out that the perceived truths of today's science could be invalidated ten years hence, it too can trigger almost fanatical behaviors. This is especially odd because he recognizes that there was a ""pseudo-science"" behind the Nazi movement. Yet a math model isn’t Truth, as I’ve told many a scientist during the 30 year history of failure of computational fluid dynamics to calculate ship resistance. The proof is still in the model test, as it has been for my entire career as a ship hydrodynamicist. Science, too, is a myth.

  An interesting and thoughtful read for history buffs, and really for non-fiction readers who might be curious about how we as a species got here.  It is a commonly held belief that we humans have rightfully emerged to ""rule over all the creatures of the earth"". This book really makes me think about this assumption, and not because the author explicitly questioned it, but rather because throughout, he implicitly suggests that our common belief in our own evolutionary brilliance may not really be a fact existing in reality anywhere outside of our own fertile imaginations as a species.  I would love to hear other readers' thoughts on this, so that makes me think this is a great book club choice.I've heard it said that we humans are not necessary to the survival of ecosystems, not even the ones we inhabit.  I've also heard it said that germs are the true masters of the universe. Yes, the guys truly at the top of the food chain are invisible to you on an ordinary day, but they can fell you, nonetheless.  Now there are some thoughts to make us rethink the stories we have told ourselves about our own brilliance, importance, strength.I defy anyone to read this book and come away thinking the same way about themselves.

  I felt like the author gathered trivial snippets he liked, put them together and created the book. An example here and an example there.  Add a controversial statement. Blend in a dig at an institution. Mix in a bit of light-weight, readable prose. I had to read it for a university course. I especially don't like how he treated the subject of religion. The author comes from Israel, the home of the three big monotheistic religions, but he seemed like he was biased and had a political and religious axe to dig. I understand that he is writing for a target market that is atheistic and secular, but it was a commercial venture aimed at a left-wing audience. I prefer balanced politics and a balanced perspective on history.

  All you have to do to get what this book is about is read the high praises given on the dust cover: Barack Obama, The New York Times, The Washington Post....and other Neo-Communist/socialists. The chapter called ""Capitalist Hell"", tells it all about this Author and you need read nothing else from the book. This Author lives in a world where he can make himself Rich selling a ""Product"", his own thoughts. Yet he demeans Capitalism as a gigantic evil. This book and it's Author is a waste of your time, if you appreciate American work values and the method of commerce that has created Billionaires.....who are not criminals, for the most part. He writes about the stupendous growth of wealth, then speculates on the greediness of business owners. To him, they are ALL greedy simply for creating a Business a business in the first place and he advocates that they all be watched over by big Government, which he tries to disguise as ""Kings and Priests"".  If you want to join the Anti-American, Anti-Business Club, by all means read this Manifesto. It's just Karl Marx disguised as your friendly Globalist. Fearing evil, he wishes to create an evil to squash it. It's scary, that this little Marxist can write this kind of thing and it sells big all over the Globe. The roaches never leave the house. On pages 220-222, the Author tackles the problem of Evil, asking why there is suffering etc, then goes on to adroitly tear down the duelist, monotheistic Religions. Apparently Buddhism was never on his book shelf because Buddhism does explain Evil as an expression of ignorance about the Self. He also stated that no one had the guts to call the God ruling us Evil...again, he didn't hear about Kabir, who stated that the ruler of this world, the God of Time, is in fact Evil. This Marxist tears down Religion and Capitalism, yet shows a huge gap in his Knowledge on these subjects. He just Philosophizes, without any real depth or understanding. Save yourself a headache, and read, Before the Dawn. by Nicholas Wade. No politics, no push to end our way of life and turn to Globalism....just a good read, on the early history of Mankind.

  It brings me no joy to say that “Sapiens” is a complete piece of garbage. After all the rave reviews and mentions by many industry leaders, I was quite excited to dig into this book. Yet, after forcing myself to finish this book, I still can’t help but feel this was a complete waste of money.From the first chapter, you get the sense that Harari over-generalizes and many of his points are extremely broad observations. This would be fine for a sociology book - yet “Sapiens” is masquerading as a history book.One example: he mentions that scientific research has indicated that people cannot maintain more than 150 individual relationships; therefore groups of 150+ people are hard to organize. Sure, makes sense. But then, Harari makes the massive jump in logic by saying that countries, organized religion, etc. were created to organize and control people.This book is filled with utter nonsense, like this alongside strawman arguments, unsubstantiated opinions, and condescending tone. It doesn’t help that at certain points he is clearly pushing his liberal, vegan, propagandistic agenda. He also seems to particularly attack religion ... yet doesn’t seem to understand any of them too well. From my own readings and experiences, he got several fundamental tenets of Buddhism, Christianity, and Catholicism completely wrong. I have a feeling he misrepresented others as well. Not a big surprise this book became popular in a society that is more religiously uneducated than ever before.In summary, those who want to hear Harari’s speculation and opinion can buy this book. But don’t expect science or history out of it.

  This is a work of speculative history. There is a lot of imaginative speculation about the development of human civilization that went into this book and, unfortunately, not all of it is clearly labeled as so. But I can see why the book is so popular: it is written in an informal, engaging style, and the author offers unconventional and interesting ideas and opinions about humanity.The author is an admirer of Diogenes, the founder of the Cynic school. The main theme throughout the book is that (as opposed to, say, gravity)  religion, democracy, justice, human rights, nations, and money are all regressive myths designed to keep society under control. These figments of the imagination are not subjective, but intersubjective, and are enforced by violence. But violence alone is not enough to sustain them, so true believers are needed. According to him, what made the human species successful is the widespread presence of true believers in these myths.The author presents a lot of speculation as fact. This might be an innocent byproduct of the book's informal style, or even an artifact of translation. Regardless, this is unfortunate because his status as a professional historian may mislead readers into believing that those speculations are established historical theories. For example, he says that the Stone Age was really the Age of Wood, when there is no evidence that the majority of artifacts during a time, when there were no metal tools to shape and cut wood, were made of wood and not stone (in fact, he sort of claims that the absence of evidence actually confirms this, as the imagined wood artifacts would not have survived to the present while the stone ones did, creating a bias).His view of animal suffering is simplistic. Farming animals live in a symbiotic relationship with humans, which is a very common form of association throughout the biological world. If farming animals were being disadvantaged, this relationship would not exist (e.g., cows and pigs would not grow, sheep would not produce wool, etc.). Biology would take care of that. However, man is the only animal who actually has moral requirements in their treatment of other animals, so these ""suffer"" less in their relationships with humans than with other non-human animals.All in all, this is an easy, if repetitive at times, read, and some of his unconventional ideas can be stimulating and thought-provoking.

  Once in a while along comes a book that forces us to rethink our world, gives us a startling new perspective on various issues of when, what, and why of our past, enhances our understanding of our current world, and stimulates well grounded speculation about our future.  Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind  by Yuval Harari is such a book.  No matter how busy we are in the day to day concerns of our life, Harari gives us a new insight into the full spectrum of human life,  how it developed, why we came to be what we are, and what all this means for each of us.  In a few passages Harari assumes, or an understanding of what he writes is at least benefited by, some familiarity with important books ranging from the Bible to the Koran, social phenomena as disparate as Buddhism and the Catholic Church, political movements ranging from liberalism to communism and the histories of China and the British Empire.  In the pattern of books otherwise very different from each other such as the Book of Genesis and the novel Hawaii by James Michener,  Harari begins with as close to the beginning as is practically possible.  From the multiplicity of human forms that preceded and for a while coexisted with our species homo sapiens, he takes us through a tour reaching back to, and beginning with, the dawn of human existence to the opening of the future that is about to be among the possibilities of our fate.  A point inherent in all this is how much that fate is up to our collective choices today. That he does so much in a book relatively short for the time covered and the range of ideas conicdred is a remarkable achievement.

  I bought this book expecting something on par with Carl Sagan's ""Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors."" Sagan's narrative on ""the history of everything"" is a true historical study, presented in laymen's terms. Sagan presents the data - you draw your own conclusions.This book on the other hand is plagued by Harari's opinions and personal experiences in life. He actually uses the word ""I"" in several paragraphs - how are we to take this book seriously when the author so blatantly inserts his personal bias?To give you an idea of the author's agenda, here are just three of the claims he makes:1. Hunter-gatherers lived in a utopia with no problems whatsoever, and they never intended for the Agricultural Revolution to happen. Everything is worse off because of the Agricultural Revolution. So are we to assume that longer lifespans, increased security from natural threats, and lower infant mortality rates are all negatives?2. Veganism is the only proper culinary habit, and anything other than veganism amounts to barbarity. In what's supposed to be a scientific book, he completes the chapter on modern agriculture with a picture of a scared cow - I'm assuming to try and convert you (the reader) to veganism.3. Women are superior to men in every aspect, and men have nothing to offer society other than aggression and violence. The patriarchy is a horrible institution, and all men should go back to fighting each other while women nurture the world into a modern utopia.Overall, the book is plagued by a ""doom-and-gloom"" attitude, and tries to make you feel bad about pretty much everything. If I were an 18-year old college student being exposed for the first time to basic anthropological and historical concepts, I might well be fascinated by this book. But if you've done any prior reading on history and anthropology, you won't get anything new out of this book.

  The author blatantly promotes fundamentally wrong ideas about biology, evolution, sexuality and history. The author is openly gay, which by itself is no reason to criticize anyone’s professional work, but in this case, it is evident that his personal sexual preferences do motivate the ideas he proposes in this book, and in order to push his ideas he goes as far as denying fundamental scientific truths universally acknowledged and in doing so he commits several grave mistakes.For example, he claims that “from a biological perspective, nothing is unnatural”. This in itself should make it clear enough how far he is willing to go and how many scientific truths he is willing to deny to justify his ideas, but he adds further down, “Evolution has no purpose. Organs have not evolved with a purpose”. Wrong, all these claims are wrong. Evolution has developed every single organ in the human body and actually in every living form with two purposes, first, to improve the individual’s or the community’s chances of survival in a specific environment and, second, to spread the species. I am not making these two claims randomly, they are the conclusions reached by Charles Darwin in his revolutionary work “The origin of species”, the foundation of modern biology, and they are what every biologist, geneticist and naturalist will tell you. Darwin said, “Intelligence is based on how efficient a species became at doing the things they need to survive”. There is evolutionary intelligence.He also claims that “A truly unnatural behavior, one that goes against the laws of nature, simply cannot exist”, then he adds, “Whatever is possible is by definition natural”. These two assertions are nothing more than his own opinion, yet he portrays them as undisputable scientific facts and then he builds his thesis on them. An ‘unnatural’ behavior is one where an individual of any species behaves making use of his/her/its organism in a way different from what evolution developed it for. This is not a philosophical hypothesis, it is a definition which has real and practical implications for the individual and his/her/its community. A community of individuals well adapted to their environment thanks to the work of evolution and with the capacity to reproduce will most likely produce new generations of offspring over and over, and with every generation they will pass down their most useful genetic traits to the new generations and will continuously improve the specie’s survival skills  and most likely increase the numbers of the community. Humanity is the best example of such a process. The author’s effort to portray homosexuality and heterosexuality as biologically undistinguishable pushes him to deny these evident truths since a homosexual community would, for obvious reasons, be extinguished within a generation and would not able to join the community in this process.He also tries to explain his proposition with biased historical and philosophical arguments. He claims, “In truth, our concepts ‘natural’ and ‘unnatural’ are taken not from biology, but from Christian theology”. He does not seem to realize that Christianity has historically been, worldwide speaking, a minority. Today the Christian world accounts for about 2.4 billion people, or about 30%, of the world’s population, yet even in non-traditionally Christian societies, such as China, India, etc., Christianity was never a dominant doctrine. Actually, in some countries like Japan Christianity was persecuted for centuries and today, although it is not a persecuted cult anymore, it still remains a religion practiced by about only 2% of the population. Two thirds, or about five billion people of the world’s population belong to non-Christian societies, therefore Christianity could have hardly been the factor that shaped their views on natural and unnatural definitions of sexuality. The non-Christian part of the world has historically given to the union of a man and a woman a different treatment from that given to the union of two men or two women. Besides, Christianity has existed for about only two thousand years, whereas we have written history for about five thousand years beginning with Mesopotamia and Egypt, and never before the year 2001, when  The Netherlands became the first country in the world to legalize gay marriage, did any society give equal treatment to the union of a man and a woman or two men or two women. That leaves a gap of three thousand years of written history where there was no gay marriage and there was no Christian church to blame for this prohibition, but we have undisputable evidence that there was heterosexual marriage. Again, the author’s thesis is fundamentally wrong.Once again, I strongly state that I have no issues with the author’s open sexual preferences and I am willing to praise the work of any author, regardless of his or her sexuality, when such a work is unbiased and well documented, however I do feel that the ideas presented in this book have been influenced by the author’s personal sexuality and that is the Achilles hill that flaws an otherwise interesting read. I hope not to have offend anyone, and if I did I am sorry, but I have substantiated my review with historical and biological arguments. Regards.

  I decided to read this book after seeing the stellar Amazon reviews from so many other readers, but was pretty disappointed after reading it.While the author makes some interesting and thought provoking points about culture and society, I found most of the book to be a tedious mish-mash of so-called revelations about obvious facts, cursory recitation of selective scientific research on various issues, and mostly the author's personal views on various issues which he tries to pass off as ""the truth"".One example:  the author goes on and on about how humankind made a foolish but voluntary decision to transition from hunting/foraging to agriculture--the happy-go-lucky hunter became the toiling peasant, on a purely voluntary basis--ie, if the hunter/forager knew what was good for him (the author clearly believes that he did not), then mankind would have continued as hunter/foragers forever, living what the author considers to be an idyllic existence.  Meanwhile, elsewhere in the book, the author notes that most large animals became extinct shortly after Sapiens moved into their habitat...  Hello, maybe hunter/foragers had no choice but to move to agriculture because hunting/foraging had become unsustainable--hunter/foragers had already devoured all of the resources (large game, berries, fish, whatever) within their range, and so had the choice of transitioning to agriculture or starving.I'm no expert, but I lost confidence in the author when he did not even raise the scenario above as a possibility but rather prefers to deride the disastrous but avoidable move to agriculture...many of his arguments seemed to be based on his personal beliefs/ideology rather than science or even common sense.The author makes many  similar arguments in the book, but I won't recount them all.  Generally, I would rate most of this book as two stars, but have tacked on a star because he does make some interesting points.

Im only half way through this jokers rant because i could barely stand that anyone would publish BS like this. So unprofessional, especially after reading Steven Pinkers awesome book.

  Sapiens is not a tough read, in fact I wish it had been available for me to give my children when they entered high school.  However, don’t mistake that wish to mean the book is child’s play.The book did challenge some of my own beliefs in regard to religion, the future of Sapiens, the chapter on happiness, to name a couple. And reading something that might make me squirm or scowl isn’t a bad thing.  Havari didn’t change all my beliefs, but being challenged is a good thing. (Don’t shy away from a history book because there is a happiness chapter... It makes sense when you’re done.)The end chapter(s) discuss current (in 2014) science projects that might change who we are as Sapiens.  And Havari’s follow-up book Homo Deus apparently discusses our humankind future in depth.Havari promises a brief history, and at 415p (Kindle) it is brief.  Yet don’t mistake “brief” as incomplete.  He really touches on all the bases, and adds historical snippets I was previously unaware of.The index and bibliography are excellent.  I have already highlighted several of the sources he used that I would like to explore.I waffled between 4 & 5 stars.  Initially I leaned toward 4 stars since the book was well written, but certainly not a favorite of mine.  But such a rating would be unfair to the Havari.  But landing as a “favorite” does not a 5 star make.  Havari’s work was researched well, laid out well, and kept its promise.  He earned the 5 stars, perhaps because he did challenge a reader’s belief system.I’d recommend it to friends.

  This is an excellent book.  The main theme is that all organizations, government, religious, universities, you-name-it, are bogus, figments of our imaginations, social constructs that are myths.  Actually, I'm surprised that the powers-to-be let this book be published; because, according to Professor Harari, Israel, the United States, and all countries are not real, just words on a piece-of-paper.  I get this.  I have two complaints.  At the beginning of the book, Professor Harari does not mention anything about the Homindae, the creature from which Homo-sapiens and chimps and all other apes (like Homo-erctus) evolved from.  Also, early on he says that the Declaration of Independence is wrong because there is no such ""thing"" as equality and Human Rights.  He says that the Declaration of Independence should read, ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men evolved differently, that they are born with certain mutable characteristics, and that among these are life and the pursuit of pleasure.""  Ha.  And, I agree.  Essentially, he is saying that there are many differences from one person to the next.  Then later, maybe 50 pages more into the book, he writes that there are no biological differences between races.  Ha!  Which way do you want it?  In my margin I wrote, ""Are not black people better athletes in general?""  Professor Harari conveniently does not mention the black athlete's superiority, in general.  Nice.

  How can I withhold praise from a famous writer such as Yuval Noah Harari? Well, I'm honest, that's how. I would have given the book three stars, but I'm not that brave, so I am compromising. The book is not merely an ""easy read,"" as many fans have said in one way or another, it's like Tolstoy, or Darwin, or Einstein, but simplified for a National Geographic TV special, and I know that sounds elitist, but it's my honest feedback. He doesn't go back to the Big Bang especially with his history, but mostly concentrates on tens of thousands of years of human history, mostly on what he calls the cognitive revolution, the agricultural revolution and where we are today, which is a blend of heaven and hell, somewhat like old Lava Lamps where two chemicals in the base swirl but never can mix properly (I actually agree with Harari on this, but also many others who favor evolutionary biology and psychology and similarly believe that our civilization is way out of sync with how we've evolved as a species). It's an ambitious book, actually, so I'll only question one aspect of it: He argues that everything, and I mean everything you know of (other than mountains and rivers and some other natural phenomena), is in fact an ""imagined reality"" and ""socially constructed."" He's clear that ""imagined"" does not mean ""unreal,"" but if so, what's the issue? Well, different cultures can be different; different beliefs are not necessarily better than any others, all religions are equally made-up and even ""human rights"" are made-up, and more. Well, that sounds like relativism, then. Is that what he wants? In spite of this, he clearly advances, in one section, a straight-up Progressive political agenda, such that he must think some ""imagined realities"" and ""social constructions"" are better than others. In fact, I personally agree with most Progressive ideals, etc., but when he argues there is no proof of anything, but then advances some things over others, I think either I'm lost, or he is.

  As a student of history and a fiction writer, it is rare that I find a book that ensnares the scope of the human story in accessible language. I have written many papers and 2 long theses in historical prose. Each time I have lamented their restricted audience. Sapiens is such a rare find. Erudite, accessible, and engaging, our story is told for us all. It is easy to understand that as a species, we have accomplished much; however, it is equally easy to understand that the stakes are high for our way forward. Progress is an imperative that must extract from the environment. Psychologically and physically, are we capable of surviving what remains of a toxic world that we will have created? Right now, we can predict probabilities using algorithms, but we cannot divine cause and effect. By the time the Sapiens story is done, I'm not sure the answer will have any relevance to the successor.

  I had a hard time with this book at the beginning.  The first few chapters were very interesting as it dealt with anthropology and explained well how homo sapiens were just one kind of hominem alongside Neanderthals. That whole early human history and the rise of homo sapiens as the sole and dominant species deserves a book of its own. However, the author began to insert opinion and speculation after those few chapters and declared the agricultural revolution a fraud and the trap of humanity. While he was quick to point out that hunter gatherer lifestyle should not be romanticized because they had really harsh lives, he does exactly that throughout the book, deeming farming societies as the worse thing that happened to human kind while dreaming about a beautiful life hunting game and picking wild fruit. He says that agriculture domesticated us and made us sick and miserable, and appeared to be advocating for us to go back to live like hunter gatherers. If being a forager was so awesome to begin with, our ancestors would not even have considered farming. the truth is that hunting and gathering was a tremendously difficult and harsh life. Often they went hungry for long periods of time and that's why they had to constantly move, to find food. Their existence was dedicated to finding food and avoiding being food themselves. Not so great. At that point I felt the book was glossing over important milestones of human evolution to give critique to our society today as a direct result of that one event in history. I found myself rolling my eyes more than once and I almost gave up reading the rest of it.  However, I decided to stick it out.After I got through the ""ode to foragers"" section of the book it got much better and I learned interesting tidbits of human history. The author in one passage explains how economic opportunity was often out of reach in the times before capitalism, often you were born a servant or a slave and you had to remain that way until you died. ""The economic game was rigged by legal restrictions and unofficial glass ceilings."" It's funny that the same system that gave everyone the opportunity to succeed is now perverted to the point that it resembles feudalism today.The author goes through many other eras and important events such as globalization, the technology boom, to robotics and the beginnings of artificial intelligence. I found all the points and tidbits of information fascinating. In one of the final chapters he explains how research funding is tied to commercial use, particularly the food industry.  Not all is bad however and even though the research is typically aimed at increased or more efficient production, some important discoveries have been made from them.There is so much in this book to talk about and take with you or get upset and enraged about. However, that's precisely why I think it is a brilliant piece. History is supposed to be boring, but Mr. Hariri changed that with this book.

  This is a sweeping historical narrative of how as a species we got to where we are today from small beginnings. From the first few paragraphs, it was clear that this book is dense with information and minimal fluff, and the rest of the book did not disappoint. The writing is clear and engaging, if a bit simplistic (probably due to Hebrew-to-English translation). This book has a lot to offer, and I learned a lot.Harari emphasizes how much we has evolved with the use of ""shared fictions"" and story-telling, which I think is an under-appreciated lens through which to view history. There is evidence in evolutionary psychology that our minds are biased towards story-telling and narrative, in ways that do not necessarily optimize for truth-seeking, and although Harari doesn't touch on this evidence, this I found this a welcome theme throughout the book.I found a few areas of the book - areas that coincide with my own academic background - pretty weak, and sadly damage the credibility of the author. Harari heaps an almost bizarre level of disdain on the Agricultural Revolution, arguing that life was better in hunter-gathering societies. But he presents almost no evidence for this, and does not even attempt to charitably address the alternative view. The continued productivity gains from spending fewer and fewer inputs to achieve food output has freed up enormous human capital towards other endeavors (in the US only 2% of workers produce domestic food consumption - with export surplus), but Harari makes no attempt to acknowledge or address this mainline economics viewpoint, ignoring opportunity cost of human capital while focusing on the more visible costs. Relatedly, the chapters on economics beginning with ""The Capitalist Creed"" I found to be particularly sloppy, with virtually no citations (three to be exact) in the entire chapter, and too many appeals to emotion. Like many authors without economics training, it would be far better for Harari to have consulted with an economist to clean up the writing and avoid some common traps.Relatedly, the book contains a significant number of claims that contain neither a citation nor an effective argument in support of. In part, this is what makes the book so readable (unencumbered with too much detail or supporting argument). This is in stark contrast to ""Behave"" by Robert Sapolosky, which is much the opposite style (tons of detail, citations, supporting arguments, and admission of alternative views). All of this leads me to believe that this is more of an opinion piece than it's presented as.But Harari's narrative is captivating, and worth listening to. Well worth the read, so long as a small bit of skepticism is maintained.

  The book begins with anthropology and a lot of conjecture from the author's reality and politics.  At some point, the author then moves into into sociology with a politically correct coloring as he tries to make the case for globalization and other pc issues.  .Obama as the current alpha male was one of the places where the author started to lose me. Unity vs diversity also was difficult to see.  Overall, people I know liked this book so I decided to read it but was disappointed.  Now I realize that they see things through the author's political viewpoint so this book fed their confirmation bias and didn't challenge their thinking.

  A few years ago it occurred to me that the only thing really holding society together is habit and that money is just a concept.  It scared me to think that society was so fragile. The author of Sapiens describes this much better than I.  And, he made me feel better since, although learned, social structures are relatively resilient.  In fact, he describes why some forms are more resilient than others.This book is full of issues that we should all be thinking about.  It is more of a history of social structures than a history book in the classical sense. It describes how the structures of human societies have changed, from when we were just another animal, through hunter gatherers, through agriculture, through science and industry, and finally our future (or replacement) based on tinkering with our own genetic code.Although Sapiens is well thought-out and well presented, I don't agree with everything the author says.  But, I think that is ok.  The main idea is to describe the changes in sociology of humans, and present various theories about why things happened as they did.  Most of my disagreement seem like semantics, but when I was reading the book I thought the distinctions were important.Here are a couple examples of my disagreements:The author uses the word ""fictions"" to describe things that are not concrete: things that can be perceived in people's minds but not in the physical world.  Examples in the book are corporations and money. These specific things would not exist if people did not think of them in their minds.  And, it is true for most of the sociological concepts presented in the book.  But, I think the author is too general.  I would prefer the term ""abstract"" rather than ""fiction."" Fiction implies unreal.  I believe that some abstract things are real.  The classical example is Plato's view that perfect abstract concepts are actually more real than the concrete representation. Such as, a drawing of a circle on a piece of paper is merely an imperfect attempt to represent the concept of a perfect abstract circle.  But, Plato would claim that the abstract concept of a perfect circle would still exist even if no one was around to think about it.  And, I basically agree with him.  And, I think there are many other abstract concepts like that.  Humans have many abstract concepts, some were created by people, some were discovered by people. Only the former are ""fictions.""Another disagreement is the notion of what is the ""true"" part of a religion.  His definition of the true part of a religion is its moral code and a social structure.  I understand why he does this, so he can use humanism and liberalism (and others) in the same way as Christianity and Buddhism (and others).  And, from the point of view of this specific book, this makes sense, since Sapiens is about describing how social structures have changed.  But, to me that is not true religion.  At best moral codes and social structures are the product of the true religion, at worst they are a distraction from the true religion.  To me, the true part of a religion is the part that is about getting to know God.So, read this book.  Keep an open mind. Stop once in while to think about what is written.  Then the main questions at the end is ""Where do we go from here? And, why?""  That is something we should be asking even if we never read this book.

  This is one of the best-written ""history"" books I've ever read.  I concur with the bulk of the reviews provided elsewhere. it really explores the macro trends of human history and human evolution and provides a setting for a better understanding of the world both in the past and today.  It's not just all about dates, inventions, technologies, and who conquered whom, but more about what developments occurred to make us contemporary ""humans"".  Haran takes a rather interesting turn in the last chapters when he decides to look at what he seems to feel is the most important question in human history: ""But are we happy?""  He seems to feel that it is just possible that we would have been better off (or at least happier) if we had not evolved past the hunter/gatherer stage.  In the last chapter he lays out the outline and questions he raises in more detail in his sequel book, ""Home Deus"".

  Really though provoking book. As an agnostic atheist the scientific findings and concepts in this book didn't bother me, they only further solidified my own beliefs. However, I can definitely see how this would be a difficult read for those who are devout Christians. I think this book is best suited for those with an open mind and willing to accept scientific evidence as fact.The subject matter is heavy and I often had to pause after each section to digest and consider the content before moving on. Definitely not a light 'beach read'. However, the author does an amazing job at writing it in such a way that keeps you intrigued and interested. It truly is a fascinating topic on it's own, but the author takes it a step further by including cliff-hanger-like leads into the upcoming chapters that makes it a fun read.

  I tried to get through this while withholding judgement, but it isn’t possible. This book begins with a little interesting data, but quickly becomes a horrible sequence of repetitive nostalgic drivel. He employs the sneaky trick of picking up on the zeitgeist of today and expounding on it like it’s science. It’s infuriatingly judgmental of modern life with zero acknowledgement of the benefits that make it possible for this book to be written and consumed.This isn’t a serious anthropological book, nor is it one that’s worthy of your time. If you happen to hate modern life, it will simply confirm your bias. If you don’t, you’ll want to throw it across the room before you’re infected by Harari’s groundless social psycho-babble.

  I was disappointed in this book. I expected it to catch me up on all new discoveries in Anthropology now that the new fossils are being defrosted and made accessible with global warming. The beginning chapters made me feel I had the right book. As I read more, the book seemed to be more about the author's opinions. He seems to feel that the quality of life of our ancestors chasing down large mammals, harvesting wild berries and grains was better than that of the poor soul who has to wake to an alarm clock, drive in traffic to a boring job and worry about being down-sized. Harari didn't seem to back up his opinions with his facts. Maybe it is more fun to live 40 years with death and abandonment possible at any moment - but Harari didn't convince me. I'm still looking for some books to tell me why Neanderthals never made it to Africa and why everyone who left Africa kept going to the farthest reaches of the world.

  I just finished Dr. Harari’s first book Sapiens.  I read the second , Homo Deus first because amazon.com sent it first. Sapiens is the factual historical foundation for his fascinating speculations in Homo Deus. He is an amazing writer and has an encyclopedic grasp of world history. I have been a student of history for 70 years and a professor of ancient history and pre-history for almost as many, but I never read a historian who considered human happiness as a goal or even a consideration of human history. For me the most interesting chapter in the book was Chemical Happiness near the end, in which Dr. Harari asserts that  human happiness  =  serotonin + dopamine + oxytocin, three natural peptides or brain chemicals, but doesn’t depend on the usual subject matter of history: kings, queens, aristocrats, politics, revolutions, economics, etc. Curiously the neurologist, Dr. Sigmund Freud said something very like this in 1906 when he surmised that all mental illness was caused by an unbalance of the chemicals in the brain. Then, we didn’t know what the chemicals in the brain were; now we do, but we still don’t know what the proper balance is. Dr. Harari makes an interesting metaphor for one’s individual balance using the set point of a home air conditioner. The psychiatrist Prof. Thomas Szasz suggested the there is no such thing as mental illness, all illness must be physical. How can we scientifically consider ‘mental’ illness if there is no material, physical evidence we have a mind? If the mind has no mass, occupies no space, and has no components it can never be the subject of scientific inquiry. Most (70%) of depressed people are helped by serotonin reuptake inhibitors which inhibit the recycling of whatever serotonin occurs in the brain naturally. Electric Convulsive or shock Therapy may sometimes stimulate the brain to create serotonin but is expensive and uncertain.  I recently purchased a set of ten ECT treatments for a close relative. They cost $20,000 and made no difference. As a ‘dour auld Scot meself,’ I decided this was a very fast way of wasting money.  I was reminded of the old Scots proverb:  “Of the three ways of wasting money, racing horses is the fastest, pursuing women is the sweetest, but fattening cattle is the surest.” ECT is as fast, as sweet (since it offers hope), and apparently fairly surely wasteful in most cases.  Medical science may be able to solve Dr. Harari’s equation for happiness if they finally pose the real physical problem correctly. One of the best books I have ever read and I read two or three a week. If you like it, you will love the sequel, Homo Deus.Peter C. Patton. Ph.D.

  This book was written as a substitute for an “Intro to Humanities Class” which likely would have been a first year class. As such, in first year classes professors make claims often out of context or not entirely true (nor also not entirely false) to draw students into the subject and get them thinking. It was clear such was done here, especially when mentioning European Wars and the criticism of religion, just to name a few. Often that’s the point in a class where someone raises their hand and asks a question pointing out the lack of context and sparking discussion though such cannot happen in a written dialog. Nonetheless, viewing humanity on a spectrum of where we have been is interesting, though many of his ideas for where we are going are futuristic (more sci-fi sounding than reality, as Elon Musk tends to do to rally attention towards the future) and not logical/realistic in the near future. I think the novelty on the topic and the skill of the prose contributed to the over-hyped energy around the ideas within the book. (And to be fair, there were some insightful ones. Though from an Oxford PhD I would expect fewer ideas out of context when proving a point)

  I've done a lot of soul searching since the 2016 US presidential election, wondering how someone as unqualified, immoral, bigoted and criminal as Donald Trump could garner enough support of US citizens to be chosen as president.  The mind games, propaganda and lies that people will accept has lowered my opinion of the critical thinking skills of fellow Americans, even of my own relatives.  Even though written before the election of Trump, this book is helping me to understand how humanity's need for a tribal collective story can lead to the rise of someone as incompetent as Trump, or as cruel as Hitler.  The book lays out humanity's past -- from the big bang to first organisms to various ""human"" species -- in order to see how we got where we are today, and to raise questions as to what we can expect in the future.  Will we self destruct or go in a currently unfathomable direction?  It's up to chance unless political powers rise to the occasion to move to a new positive future.  Unfortunately, political systems and cultures are not evolving as fast as technology is.  Conservative resistance to change and growth, and resistance to banding together as one human species, could be humanity's ultimate downfall. Next I will ready the author's second book, ""Homo Deus.""

  The brilliance of “Sapiens” is that it encourages the ordinary person to peek through a doorway into a critical analysis of the complex tapestry of human evolution and history. I understand if you are a World History scholar you would be familiar with all of these theories, and might prefer all of the points of view be presented with sources cited as a research paper.  And someone caught up in the treadmill of life such as me would never read it. In the age of specialization we live in now, it is far too easy for the vast majority of us to pass through life caught up in the mores of our societies, fixated on the microscopic details of each of our respective fields of specialization without seriously questioning any of it.This is not to say the points made in the book should be accepted uncritically; in fact, one of the underlying and most important messages of the book is the need for critical examinations of our belief systems.I was fascinated by the idea that our common systems of belief – religion, natural law, government law, economic theories, and so on - are all based on fictions that are given power to the degree that groupings of individuals are willing to accept them. I was familiar with this notion in a peripheral way – the point was certainly driven home during the mortgage market collapse in 2007. When people stopped believing in the value of mortgage-backed securities, the value collapsed and threatened the viability of our entire financial system. But the fact that all of human evolution and civilization has been powered by the unique ability of homo sapiens to create and believe in fictional realities is very intriguing.  The book is worth reading for this insight alone, but there is far more to it than that.“Cold indifference driven by economic greed” - I was struck by a passage that compared the numbers of those who have been intentionally harmed due to nationalism and religion to those who have been brutalized, tortured and killed simply due to cold indifference driven by economic greed. The owners of the slaves who lived short, hellish lives on sugar plantations were not motivated by animosity towards the slaves – they did it because it was the only way to profit on the production of sugar – labor costs would have been far too high otherwise to justify the investment.  Just as is the case with the cruel treatment of farm animals today; babies separated from their mothers at birth, never allowed to play or socialize, fattened in confined pens for a few short months, and then slaughtered in a horrific way. The industrial age, and factories – child labor, 18 hour days, 7 day work weeks – this existed once in the U.S. and still exists in other countries today, justified because it encourages growth, spending, and boosts the economy.The passages on religion and spiritual beliefs are certainly sobering; after thinking about it for some time, I decided that if my belief in spirituality is a comforting fiction, that I will continue to allow myself to retreat to it. We are so embedded in a world of imagined reality it is impossible to distinguish the objective from the subjective anyway. For example, a view of human history such as Sapiens is based on an interpretation of the world as perceived through our senses, but can we really trust our senses? Does the color blue exist, or is it a product of our collective imagination? There is a point in our written history in which the color blue is never mentioned.As it is, Sapiens successfully argues the power of sheer belief to give rise to reality – the very house I live in exists because someone at some point looked at the spot of land it is on, and imagined a house standing there. If our realities are shaped by the power of our imaginations, I will continue to hold on to my belief in a spiritual version of my mother because it is so important to me.Sapiens is indeed engaging, but I would not necessarily describe it as “fun,” – some of the insights are too dreadful and sobering to describe it in such a flippant way – but it is important  to step off the treadmill of life from time to time to ask the questions that the book encourages us to examine. It is indeed a gift to have such a clear, thoughtful, 10,000 foot analysis of human systems and belief presented in such a compelling and thought-provoking way. Sapiens serves as an excellent starting point for further research and analysis.

  I’d love to know more about the people who didn’t like this book. So many say his book was based on opinions and I understand why they’d say that. However, so much of the history I was taught in school was straight up opinion or lies. Sapiens is the first book that’s offered a wider perspective. I often found myself blown away at the connections. It connected things for me I couldn’t. I think everyone should read this book. Don’t allow the bad reviews to dissuade. A lot of the negative reviews seem to be the result of cognitive dissonance. No one wants to have their beliefs placed under a microscope. Some people don’t want to admit that animals are treated poorly, capitalism is a religion and human presence destroys eco systems. You gotta be open to read this.

  The first two-thirds was a great read for me  because I  KNEW NEARLY NOTHING ABOUT THE SUBJECT.  But when he got to the sixteenth century and NEWTON it was clear HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THIS SUBJECT. I never finished reading this book. The British made Newton a hero of Science because they needed one -- IT WAS A POLITICAL DECISION. Those who brought Newton kicking and screaming to the truth were promptly forgotten.  In the last few years at least 20 books have been written on the subject.  The Key to understanding orbital mechanics was the through the characteristics of the orbital pendulum a subject discussed 60 years before Newton published  his findings and after much prodding by Robert Hook. Let me be more clear. A few years ago while studying the possible use of a  pendulum to develop standards of measure in Ancient civilizations it became obvious that if the sun were used to measure time,the accuracy achieved by ancient civilizations would have required them to measure for a full 24 hour period.  Then I thought what if the scribe selected to keep the pendulum swinging for 24 hours rebelled and threw the pendulum weight at 90 degrees to the swing ?  This would produce and Orbital Pendulum, a pendulum which mathematically orbited the center of the earth. This was a shocking discovery-within hours I  calculated the distance to the moon and proved the inverse square law of gravity. This same inverse square Law that Newton refused to admit for so many years. Newton believed that Gravity diminished  linearly with distance. Were this true, the moon would have been larger than the earth and we would be orbiting it.  The author clearly chose not to understand the physics involved.

  This book moves well beyond science to massive conjecture and myth making. It is guilty of the very criticism it lays on history and society. It is selective in what it counts as science, and is based on unreasonable extreme materialist conjecture. I was sadly disappointed. This work certainly reflects the biases and beliefs of the author, but when the answer, ""myths"", is the starting premise, you end up with circular reasoning.

  Outstanding book.  Rarely do I read a book or an author that bends my view of the world and my outlook on life.  But that's precisely what Professor Harari has done with Sapiens.  I picked it up casually enough just searching for some insight into the paleontologic evidence of how people, Homo Sapiens, came to be.  I received this insight clearly concisely eloquently and in abundance with so much more.  From the beginning of the book with it's clear timeline to the very first page that simply and precisely defines physics chemistry and biology, to it's clear explaination of human development and beyond this book  exceeds expectations. It defines history and culture and how these forces continue to shape our lives today.  It defines religion and all of the great human ideologies nationalism, capitalism socialism fascism.  It delves into evolutionary psychology and perhaps a brand new field yet to be named, evolutionary philosophy, a philosophers evolutionary understanding of the world around us. As such Sapiens is a profound philosophical tour de force and must stand with the giants who sought to explain the world around them,  Homer,  The Bible, Socrates, Plato, Nietzsche but with a much more concise and easily comphrehendable style.  Read this book and follow through its logical conclusions

  We have all done it. We have all looked up in the night sky and wondered. The sky is so big yet we are so small. What is our place in all this? How we fit into all of this?Sapiens is a very interesting look into our past. Homo Sapiens were once just another animal on this big blue marble. We were completely insignificant when compared to lions or mammoths. But over time, our minds developed, our tools changed and over just a few thousand years now dominate the world (to a devastating effect).There were three huge revolutions that dominated the human timeline. The Cognitive Revolution denotes when our brains started to surpass our animal counterparts and human cousins like the Neanderthals. The Agricultural Revolution changed our relationship with food. In many ways, this new diet harmed us but it gave us the ability to reproduce in large numbers. Finally, the Scientific Revolution marks our quest for objective knowledge.This is an incredible book. I have only one problem: the book is long but it didn’t dive deep enough. It could have easily been three separate books and been even more interesting.

  The writing is the strength here - it is remarkably lucid; he gets his points across effortlessly.  Is it a perfect book, is Hariri ""right"" about what he writes?  (Answer: if you're expecting to read any work of non-fiction that gets everything right, good luck.  Would love to know who that writer is.)  Hariri tips many a sacred cow here and his writing is, at times, hilarious.  But it's a dark book - he's unsparing in his examination of how much damage we homo sapiens have wrought on earth and doesn't suggest we'll make things better.  My favorite line (a paraphrase, from memory): ""and what about the inner lives [of the animals that serve us]? Who doesn't believe that a bull does not have better, more satisfying things it could do with its time than to be yoked to a harness and tormented by a whip-wielding ape.""

  With as many already in-depth reviews on this book, unless you stumble on this one, I doubt anyone will read this review. In as such I will keep this short.There are a few things I disagree with in the book and the author doesn't explain how he arrived as his position. He only declares it as fact. Most of the book is based on the ""inter-subjective reality"" is what set homo sapiens apart from all other creatures including other like us. He based the rest of the book of history upon this, without delving into it very much.  His bias towards some ""inter-subjective reality"" over other sis evident in his writings as well.  I'm pretty sure that was not his intention but I was able to guess his background after doing a bit research on him after reading the book. This is the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5.As for things I really like about the book. The author writing style is very good for one. It reads easy and is ordered  well. He is also not pretentious enough to believe is always right or knows the answer to everything.  The book provides competing theories that disagree with his own. He presents them in a way that doesn't put them down, instead just offering his thoughts on what might be problems in those theories. In a couple of places the author basically said ""I don't know"".  Something to me that seems very rare in a book. I like the fact he presented his case and didn't try proclaim it as absolute fact. Instead it let me to decide for myself.  While I may not have agreed with all of the book it did the one thing a great book should do. It made me think.

  Three words come immediately to mind when trying to describe this book.Ambitious: In an eminently readable style, Hariri takes you on a fascinating ride through the 150,000-year history of Homo Sapiens. The book explores the big questions of human history.Depressing: As Hariri states, we are “the deadliest species in the annals of Planet Earth.” By a wide margin, I would add.Provocative: Hariri obviously relishes in challenging conventional understandings of history. Or, put another way, the book is rife with controversial and sometimes poorly supported theories.Even if you end up disagreeing with most of Hariri’s conclusions, this is still a lively, often-insightful, and always-thought-provoking book.I’m not surprised that the book is still sold in just about every bookstore in America, nor that President Obama read it and recommended it. “Sapiens” is one of the most interesting books of popular nonfiction to come along this decade.

  Cool book. I especially liked the first section that dealt with the most ancient subjects. But the author exposed his complete lack of research when talking about Christianity in the chapter titled, ""Law of Religion,"" in the subchapter called, ""The Battle of Good and Evil."" The slightest amount of research would've led him to Matthew 13:24-30.The author claims that Christianity holds no answer to the presence of evil. The referenced scripture teaches us that God (1) has the power to destroy evil but allows it to exist, defeating the author's argument that it's contradictory that evil would exist in a universe governed by an omnipotent God. And (2) the reason why God allows evil and people He knows will end up in hell is that it allows for a greater harvest of saved people. The author tries to argue that God wouldn't allow a woman to be born if God knew the woman would end up in hell. But if God never allowed anyone to be born who would end up in hell, then there would be far fewer people who end up with Him in heaven.Overall a cool book. It must've taken a ton of research for every other part of it. But for some reason, when it came time to bashing Christianity, the author decided to forego any research and stick to his incorrect pre-conceived notion of truth, which was objectively incorrect. Christianity 100% accounts for evil in the world and why an omnipotent God allows it to exist.

  Sapiens was an awesome and really interesting book. It basically follows the history of human beings from our early caveman days up to modern times. It also has some interesting points on human myths, and not just in the religious sense, but also things like the idea of liberty and freedom or equality. All of which are human inventions of the mind which would not exist without us. I really enjoy books like this that not only teach you things but also makes you think about things you never considered before and I think that is this book's biggest strength in my opinion.

  ""Big History"" type of book with the serious probing of a historian who examines what might have happened.  Where we are now is full of paradoxes and stresses and strains, but also a lot more underlying stability than might have been expected.  A number of counterintuitive insights offered about our current status as a species.  Some serious dangers and opportunities on the horizon.  How will Sapiens evolve culturally?  Will tragic conflicts and ecologic damage be avoided?  Will we invent our future successors?  There is a little speculation of the future -- how could you resist after reviewing 60,000 years of history.

  Fascinating and very well written. Complaints that it wasn’t adequately sourced are unfair, a full list of sources is on the web.That said some of it is naturally more persuasive and insightful than other parts of it. I am not a vegetarian and deliberately try to avoid reading animal rights things, so it was a little distressed by what I learned in the book about the bond between cows and their babies and the milk industry, but felt that that was part of the whole story about the agricultural revolution. However he returned to the theme of how he would being Street other species a bit too often for my taste. It was like being trapped in a late night  ASPCA commercial and he spent very little time on how he would beings have polluted the waters in the air so that seemed odd. (That said I too cannot Unknow what I know and will be going to farm raised food as much as possible in the future.)The ending seemed a little rushed with the attention to the possibility of cyborgs and a sudden nod to new emotions. Then again, this was written 10 years ago, even though it only made its way into English in 2015.Most fascinating to me was actually not so much the part about Homo sapiens versus Neanderthals, because I have read Carl Sagan‘s “dragons of Eden” and do know a bit about that. The best part of this book in my opinion are where he explores capitalism versus commercialism the rise of empire and the whole concept of fictions meaning not so much things that are not true, as things that are ideas that we share. I had never really thought of religion and ideology that way and  I do find this completely compelling.I read this on a kindle So did not really get the benefit of the graphics. I had thought about buying it as a hard cover but unfortunately the animal-rights thrown in dissuades me. In 2021, it’s easy to see that he didn’t anticipate anything like Trump or the right wing leaders worldwide, and for my money, the attention to climate change is not strong enough.Nevertheless it is very strong and well worth reading.

  This book presents a brief history of mankind (or Homo Sapiens) from its humble beginnings as mere biological organisms to masters of planet earth.  Particularly intriguing is how evolution stopped explaining historical events after the cognitive revolution came about; and what are the challenges of mankind, from where we are today, devising technological advancements that would forever change us.A must read. But don't listen to me..., listen to what Barack Obama and Bill Gates have to say about this book:“Interesting and provocative…It gives you a sense of perspective on how briefly we’ve been on this earth, how short things like agriculture and science have been around, and why it makes sense for us to not take them for granted.” (President Barack Obama)“I would recommend this book to anyone interested in a fun, engaging look at early human history…you’ll have a hard time putting it down.” ( Bill Gates)

  I thought it was an interesting, although perhaps overrated, book. When I bought I thought it would be about the anthropological  evolution of the various hominid species, some in parallel with ""Homo Sapiens."" It does describe that, but also offers much interpretation and speculation on a variety of other subjects and issues:*  The dispersions of the several hominid species out of Africa into Asia and Europe. Thee is also much discussion and comparisons of Neanderthals and Sapiens, along with speculations on how Neanderthals eventually became extinct as a species;* The development of agriculture and settled farming. I thought Harari downplayed a significant reason for this development: farming offers a much more reliable and steady source of food compared to hunting / gathering. I thought he the presents a very romanticized view of the alleged benefits of hunting and gathering. He seems to think that farming resulted in humans becoming much more exposed to famines, whereas foragers could just move elsewhere. I think he is wrong: if droughts and floods result in area-wide famines for farmers, they will also do the same thing for hunter-gatherers in the area. Moving around for food in a drought area is in fact not an option.*  The development of religion in human society;*  The development of money and credit;*  The evolution and long-term success of multi-ethnic empires over the millennia;*  The gradual development in Western Europe of industrial technology and scientific thinking with the associated development of military power;*  The development of European colonial imperialism over Asia and Africa and the eventual collapse of these colonies.The is also some touchy-feely discursive on what constitutes human ""happiness.""

  This is a very good book for those of us who like to review comprehensive knowledge, periodically, plus like to fill in some blanks.  This is truly a work of art that should be useful to many who find time to read it.The author lectures at the Hebrew University Jerusalem.  This book has been translated into more than 50 languages.  It has sold millions of copies.The book starts with the birth of the earth, then gives us the agreed-upon years of important developments: 2.5 million years ago the earliest forms of man developed; 2 million years ago the earliest humans left Africa; 100,000 Homo Sapiens became dominant; 70,000 years ago early man began to develop cultures;  12,000 years ago began the Agricultural Revolution; 500 years ago began the Scientific Revolution.Homo Sapiens conquered the world, primarily, because of increased brain power and the ability to develop language.  In the Cognitive Revolution, about 70,000 years ago, man developed gods, myths and religions.  Larger and larger community groups were formed.  Trade between groups emerged.  This involved, per the author, “The instinct to gorge on high-calorie food was hard-wired into our genes.”  Incidents of warfare were reduced.As early man became more and more settled, their ability to rule and control led to the extinction of many, many large animals.  This occurred in all parts of the world.  Per the author, this pattern continues today, with the loss of more and more plants and animals, including those in the seas and oceans.  He calls us humans, “the deadliest species in the annals of biology.”Agricultural staples, such as rice, corn, wheat and potatoes, were cultivated inventions in the years of the Agricultural Revolution.  But per the author, an enlarged sum of food did not translate into an improved diet.  Also, per the author, the Agricultural Revolution was a trap.  “There was no going back.”  It initiated the pursuit for an easier and easier life.What this signals is one area that I found some problems with in the book.  Near the end, the author tries to make the case that things actually might have been “better” many years ago.  He talks about the quest for “happiness,” in a way that I found unconvincing.  I thought it was a flaw in a very enjoyable book.Also pointed out is that man was able to select those types of animals that could be domesticated for our needs, such as the more-timid sheep, or the strongest, but most gentle oxen.  Today, there are approximately one billion sheep, one million pigs and cattle, and 25 billion chicken being raised for the convenience of man.  But as another hit on mankind, the author says that our domesticated animals, due to the ways they are now raised, may be “among the most miserable creatures that have ever lived.”  As an example, a modern calf on a modern meat farm may spend its entire life – of only about four months – inside a tiny cage.  All this for our enjoyment of a soft, juicy steak.The earth’s surface is about 200 million square miles.  3,500 years ago, man occupied less than three percent of the earth’s surface.  For the vast majority of time, most humans were peasants.  Progress required the emergence of numbers and writing.  Cultures developed.  Money, empires and universal religions spread.  These three, per the author, “laid the foundation for the united world of today.”Per the author, “Trust is the raw material from which all types of money are minted.”  Minted coins became the money of choice because of the ease of storage and transportation.  But their value was always based on trust.Per the author, “human order is imagined.”  Empires, per the author, have been “the most common form of political organization for the last 2,500 years.”  He says that they do not work, long-term, mainly because it is not possible to rule over large numbers of conquered people forever.  At the same time, empires can be quite stable.  In the present time, per the author, “nationalism is fast losing ground.”  (Were that to be true. )Religion came during the Agricultural Revolution.  All kinds of gods emerged to try to explain what could not be explained.  Religions with multiple gods can explain differences between good and evil.  Religions with one god have problems doing that.  Per the author, Capitalism is the most successful of the modern religions.In a twist on the well-known tenant that the victors write history, the author says that “There is absolutely no proof that human well-being inevitably improves as history rolls along.”  He discusses the history of Christianity.  He seems to say that the past of history is, more or less, random or unpredictable.The advances in science came with the willingness to admit ignorance.  Its emphasis was on observations and experiments, not on praying to a god for an answer.  Until the Scientific Revolution, cultures did not believe in progress.  For example, hunger and poverty would be seen as an inevitable “part of this imperfect world.”  Now, per the author, poverty is more and more considered a technical problem.  As are our eventual deaths.  But science can be expensive.  To move forward, it needs to be in alliance with some religion or culture.It was science that turned the world toward a dominance of the Western culture.  In 1775, per the author, Asia had 80% of the world economy.  Europe was an “economic dwarf.”  But the Europeans were able to dominate the Asian powers by 1900.  This was accomplished, primarily by the military-industrial-scientific complex and “technical wizardry.”European imperialism was built on capitalism.  The discovery of America by Columbus was a big part of this.  It led to the European explore-and-conquer expeditions.  For the Europeans, building empires was a scientific project, based on capitalism.The author gives a great description of how banking works under capitalism, citing that, in some ways, it is a giant fraud, that a bank can lend money it really does not have.  But, says the author, if it is a fraud, then the entire modern, world-wide economy is a fraud.  In fact, it is all based on trust.  And it is credit that “enables us to build the present at the expense of the future.”It was credit that allowed Spain to finance Columbus, not the income from taxes.  All this was based on the belief that the total amount of wealth in the world is not limited.  Progress gives people faith and trust in the future.  But for capitalism to work well, there must be reinvestment, not just hoarding of wealth.  But, per the author, in our modern world, there also may be a limit to the continuation of “printing money.”  And, on the bad side, per the author, “Capitalism has killed millions out of cold indifference, coupled with greed.”The Industrial Revolution resulted in “an explosion in human productivity.”  It did not, however, result in any equality of wealth.  And at best, per the author, the modern economy is dependent on the masses to “give free rein to their cravings and passions to buy more and more.”Per the author, the modern era has witnessed the collapse of the family.  He views the liberation of the individual as coming with a possible cost.  He talks about “imagined communities,” as opposed to real ones.  And, we become more and more dependent on international trade.  True, violence is down, worldwide, in the past 70 years, in most parts of the world.  But, says the author, “History has still not decided where we will end up….”This is where, I think, the author begins to veer off course a bit.  Near the end of the book, he begins a discussion about whether we are “happier” or not.  He actually suggests that the thrill of a wild, successful mammoth hunt would surpass the enjoyment of just about anything in the modern world.  Huh?  Then he says that “Every new invention puts us farther away from the Garden of Eden.”  Huh?  He says that modern industrial agriculture may be our “greatest crime.”  And that “Perhaps it is also wrong to only consider the happiness of humans.”He suggests that we need to “re-engineer our biochemical system.”  He talks about the benefits of Buddhism in distinguishing what is real and what it not.The future, he says, is unknown, and most people don’t want to think about it.  He admits putting the brakes on progress is unlikely.  He says that progress will continue to be justified as a search to make things “better.”  Near the end, he says that “the Sapiens regime on earth has so far produced little that we can be proud of.”  Per the author, we have not reduced the overall suffering in the world.  And, we are accountable to no one.He ends with, “Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who don’t know what they want.”I would have preferred something like, “You’ve come a long way, baby.”  But that is not what you get from reading this book, which is full of great information on the history of humankind.

  Very disappointed in this book.  Thought it was a scientific based book into cultural anthropology and the development of humans but in reality this is a left wing opinion screed by a person chock full of errors with little basis in fact. Subsections like capitalism is hell complete with a Marxist theory of monopoly disproven by Stiglitz in the 50s and stating that 20th century thought believed in immutable cultures are just two of hundreds of examples where the author is just plain wrong.

  The key insight of Harari is that mass-scale flexible cooperation with non-kin is at the root of our success as Homo Sapiens. The evolution of a large brain and its cognitive capabilities enabled us to invent and share stories about gods, kings, money and a host of other myths that enabled us to trust, commune, cultivate, manufacture and trade with large groups that led to our dominance over earth’s resources and other species. But this success has come at the cost of planetary degradation and mutual exploitation.

  I could not believe how many good quotes and comments this book has. I started to suspect about it since Bill Gates sponsored. Not even being a literary expert it was for me outstanding how the author made some out of the blue conclusions going from A to Z without giving any logical or scientific or anthropological arguments. The lack of humbleness of the author is amazing through his writing style during the whole book. This book was written with the ego in charge big time. It is clear that the level of consciousness of the author is very limited and the lack of update knowledge about what is happening today in science merging consciousness in the world is also very limited. Starting with the many scientific communities that today's agree and proves that the theory of Darwin's is incomplete and has many flaws. Is clear that the author is not aware of modern tendency of science merging with spirituality high consciousness where science is discovering each day that in fact we humans beings are spiritual being experiencing a physical live and not the opposite. This book seems to me as it was written in the 70s. The fact that the author is very confused looking humans as just another animal that out of the blue woth no scientific explanation so far, acquired Conscience and intelligence but is still just another animal. The author such as his sponsor Bill Gates are still in a state of ignorance that evoques just compassion from me. Is like watching a 3 years old making a tantrum because his parents didn't bought him a toy. The author is still in the stage of the super human theory, that humans are just animals with intelligence. How ever this book serves a greater purpose,  the purpose of having a point of reference, we human beings learn by contrast and this book is a great example to show how many humans beings are still in a stage of ignorance and that higher consciousness is still in a very early stage on some human populations. I apologize for the long review.

  Harari's book provides a condensed history of man all the way from hominid beginnings to the rise and fall of civilizations, from Adam Smith's economic theory to a rundown of the world's most prominent religions and concludes with predictions for the future of humankind.  All of this is covered in 416 pages of superbly but simply chosen language.  Harari explains why and how civilization developed discussing the various revolutions, cognitive, agricultural, industrial, and scientific with careful, reasoned analysis.All that's missing is the spiritual component.  Harari's review of religions as shared myths is dismissive for the most part.  The striving for individual enlightenment that Buddhists practice is the one exception.  Mostly his attention is placed on the ""we"" versus ""they"" attitudes that have been the cause of countless wars and human suffering.  He also postulates that capitalism, nationalism, and socialism are modern religions.Harari paints a positive picture of the future which involves genetic experimentation and engineering all in the service publicly stated by many scientists as necessary to address the world's problems of dwindling resources and debilitating disease.  He states that the real purpose is to make Man, or whatever Man becomes immortal.  His optimistic view is that man will resolve future problems through scientific advancements alone.Though I disagree with some of Harari's conclusions and predictions, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the human race, where it's been and where it's going.  It is a must-read for those who are willing to examine their beliefs.

  The professor of history presents a superb history of human development in language that is easy to grasp. The first 60-70% of the book is excellent but then he moves to contemporary criticism and belief in global warming among other current dogmas. So the book moves from an understanding of human development to a professorial update on how and why we must do this or that. On the whole the book is worth reading but the concluding chapters have been detailed before with the same academic prejudice.

  -I realize this book is just a survey and not a scientific survey.  It has some very interesting and funny anecdotes.  -However, as a description of religion and philosophy it is very disappointing and not very accurate.-The whole point of the monotheistic and invisible God came from the nomadic invasions from the steppes.  These herders and nomads on horseback did not have time for idles and temples, they were mobile herders and horsement. Their gods were INVISIBLE and OMNIPRESENT!  This is what they bring to religion.  It wasn't until the Hellinization of Judaism and the Romanization of Chrisitianity (need for royal lines with Moses and David) that ""modernization"" of these religions occured.  The need for royal pedigrees and unification into One (or the Holly Trinity) occured.  These  original nomadic invaders on their horses with stirrups conquering everything in their way and making chariots and paid armies obsolete (David vs. Goliath).  The gentie shepherd really a fierce warrior used to defending his flock against violent attack by wild animals and human marauders.  These invaders eventually become the Iranians (Persian) and Hebrews.  The conquest of Palestine was a Genocide by any definition (READ YOUR BIBLE).  The Hebrew God ordered tha slaying of all men, women, and children who had occupied this area.  The slaying was so barbarous that the soldiers could not return to the Isreali camp for seven days to let the brutality in them subside.  THIS IS YOUR HISTORY WRITTEN BY YOUR PEOPLE!  The SS had a great template to follow to spread their religion.  Perhaps because he is an Isreali, he doesn't want real history to be explained.-Second major problem with this work was the confusing and erroneous confusion he has with religion,philosophy, and political system.  Philosophy and religion are interwined (because religions want to rationlize their existence), but they are NOT THE SAME!  This portion (extensive) of this book is not even up to sophomore college standards!Al that said, their were some interesting anecdotes.

  I periodically read world histories.  There have been changes in the accepted ideas about the great transitions and it's nice to keep up with current ideas about them.  This was one such world history, and I think it's been a good choice.  I do wish I'd gotten a book, rather than rely on Kindle, though, because the graphics and illos do not zoom.  Some of them remained illegible in the Kindle format.Even without certain of the maps and graphics, this was well-written and beautifully complete narrative, up until about 60% of the way through.  This explanation about cultural institutions in the great civilizations explaining what happened in and after the age of the gunpowder empires seemed overdrawn.  Perhaps it was an original synthesis?  At 1500 CE, any of the great civs had an opportunity to dominate, in the new era of gunpowder empires.  Locally, all of them did, at that time.  Yet, as we know, the Chinese simply stopped.  The Indians did not sustain, and the Islamicate empires gradually lost ground to the Europeans.  In my day in school, the explanation was entirely racist.  Other models succeeded that silly idea, and the one in this book is yet another new modeling of the underlying factors which may have leaned weight on the European pans of the scales.  Worthwhile, and it recovers from the turgid moments extolling capitalism's role to finish bravely.  Recommended!

  I'm glad I read it, but it wasn't always pleasant. Thought provoking. The author does a very good job of showing stages where we Humans moved up to the next level and why; on that score it is excellent. He makes a good case for questioning if we were really better off after those leaps. Less good was that a lot of space was devoted to his opinions, such as opining that modern meat production = animal cruelty, and that all philosophy from religion to nationalism should be considered to be fiction/myth. He spent way too much time preaching on subjects which did not contribute to the book's theme.

  I did not know if the author was trying to be funny or just was really bitter when he opined. Harari’s writing style reminds me of a know-it-all PhD who is constantly throwing in sarcastic and unnecessary remarks that do add little or no value to what he is saying. If anything, these jabs seem to be added just to shock or upset the reader. It is shame because the book does have some good information and theories explaining why and how Homo sapiens have arrived now from their beginnings. Some of his theories could have been better explained because there were leaps of logic. Also, many of these ideas are not really new.I would have given four out of five stars, but the author’s attitude really grated on my nerves.

  Maybe this is even the best one! There is a weak citation by Bill Gates on the cover of the book suggesting that this book is about early human history. It is not the best citation, but I guess Bill Gates is famous and that is why his word were used. The books goes way beyond that. It goes beyond the great book Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond. It covers, analyzes, and synthesizes not just history of our species, but it touches and explains economy, money, power, empires, governance, religions and philosophies, happiness, meaning of life, and our prospects as species and individuals. I recommend this book to everyone. I would rather find this book in a hotel night stand drawer than bible or koran. I already re read some chapters from it. It does not have answers  for meaning of your life but definitely helps you to  better understand and shape it. I did not agree with certain statements or language used in some sections, but this was not significant and with some tolerance I was able to read through these sections and still agree on higher meaning of the covered topic. The book got better and better as I red it, with the best chapters toward the end. Definitely the fingerprint on the book cover was well earned and I have respect for the man who wrote it.

  Harari writes well and simply. But his simplification often does not serve imparting scientific concepts. The book conveys certainty when much is tentative or doubtful. Harari skips over many controversies while wasting pages on others that are rather silly, and so misses much of the meaningful story of anthropology. Several facts are not up to date, and many conclusions, such as the hominin brain evolving for sociality, and that ""we are all pure sapiens,"" are just plain wrong.Much of the book is the author's philosophy of history, not history per se. Most of those opinion pieces are overwritten (unnecessarily drawn out).

  This book provides an objective look at the process of early mankind to today's world.  The author breaks down mankind's impact on the world around them.  Spoiler alert: humans tend to have a very negative impact on everything to improve our own ability to survive and comfort.  Don't get me wrong, this is the case for most living things that need to survive in a world of constant threats, but the author's brief reminders of how the way mankind survives requires the subjugation of all organic and inorganic systems around them really puts some things in perspective.There are many interesting insights on how social constructs have been formed throughout history and how the formation of a common market and currency impacted the way people deal with one another.  There are a lot of moving parts to this book (which should be obvious given the span of time it covers) and it will really make you consider how all of the components of history have molded our society.  There are a lot of constructs we all participate in without really every questioning or giving a second thought to, and the author puts it quite plainly how absurd some of these constructs are.  There were also some interesting pieces of Buddhist philosophy that come up in the book that I found to be particularly interesting given my very minor exposure to the philosophy.I couldn't put this book down and couldn't recommend it enough.

  First off I am not familiar with anthropology. This is my first foray into the field so things that might appear to me to be novel and specific to the author Harari might be part of anthropology lore or dogma. However, my reading material can be considered very eclectic—I read books on a very wide range of topics.When I say this is an Amazing book I mean that on almost every other page I would find myself highlighting something that I found eye-opening.Here are some examples of what I consider remarkable ideas. The first has to do with the 3 great revolutions that have had a major effect on the lives of humans and their social revolution/evolution: The Cognitive Revolution, The Agricultural Revolution and The Industrial Revolution.What skill did we gain which resulted in a major change the direction of the development of humans? Read it and you will be surprised and impressed. It has to do with storytelling – kind of.Then there is Credit and Money. I now look at the world in a very different way with awe and also with fear. What can you imagine that could be so awesome and yet can also create a lot of fear?Oh yes, what about linking empire building with the Scientific Revolution and the appearance of capitalism! Harari sees links that I find really surprising.There is also a warning about wishing for the good old days and what it was really like in terms of very basic and simple things (like bathing and clothes) we take for granted today that were nonexistent 300 years ago.For me I would have preferred the second part of the title as the main title. Sapiens sounds like a biology book, and the second part could be made to be more intriguing reading material for anyone as “A Short History of Humans”.I hope you enjoy the book and find it as fascinating as I did!

  Billed as history, this book is really an anthropological overview of humanity.  I found it by accident because it was discounted at the time I was looking for some science.  So I gave it a try and was happily surprised. I found it well written and authoritative. After 60 years of reading, few books present me with some idea that makes me stop, and think, and say to myself, ""Yes, that is so obvious.  Why didn't I think of it that way before!""  That is exactly what this work did.  Additionally, his view of the future for Homo Sapiens, somewhat pessimistic, matches my own views exactly.

  It's rare that I don't finish a book, so I forced myself to suffer through this superficial accumulation of nothing far longer than I should have. It begins with a seemingly harmless streamline of the evolution of man (homo SAPIENS) , with historical and anthropological shortcuts that threaten to support a larger thesis. The book continues in the same vein with its take on the impact of the agricultural and industrial revolutions, climate, social connectivity and culture. There is no point. There is no unifying message, and there is no citation for the leaps of logic and conclusions drawn from hypothetical examples the author contrives.

  If there ever was a must-read book, this has got to be it. Contained within its pages are a multitude of splendid insights, often several on each page, succinctly explained.This book will challenge many of the conventional wisdoms you've believed in for probably all your life. Find out why homo sapiens are less like the majestic lions and whales that used to be at the top of the food chain before humans displaced them and more like banana republic dictators. I'll stop here so I don't give away the plot.A couple of critiques, just to keep it real. Not sure why the author provides the example of force = acceleration divided by mass (p. 255) when the actual formula is f = ma. Perhaps he is just trying to be funny. Not surprisingly, a few other errors have crept into the last section (part 4) ""The Scientific Revolution"" that did not appear previously. Nothing I consider serious. On page 260 the author uses the word ""I"" for the first time. I doubt this is intentional, given the commendable effort of having avoided doing so in the previous 2/3rds of the book. Sloppiness that often enters the picture as the book is nearing publication and everyone gets restless. This is especially understandable in a section on ""The Scientific Revolution"" where things change faster than anyone can type. So, the anxiousness is almost forgivable.Just a little trivia before I close. There's this fascinating example on pp. 269-270 about Queen Eleanor's 16 births, resulting is just one male hair (Edward) over a period of 29 years (1255-1284). That's just over one child birth every two years. And, before go thinking that's not so bad, recall that this doesn't include probably large number of miscarriages that can be assumed to have occured. So it was pretty much back to back pregnancies. Not an easy life being a queen that doesn't produce a surviving male heir.The hardcover edition is beautifully produced with heavy weight paper that highlighters (which I use liberally) will nevertheless dry quickly on. Color illustrations add to the pleasure of going through this labor of love.Read it. You will learn a huge amount. I sure did.

  This is the second of Mr. Harari’s books I have read.His questions and observations about our present and past, I found very interesting. I wonder why we, as a species, continue down this path towards destruction of our home planet, and how many more generations will it take til we begin to really appreciate this wonderful world we have been given and will learn to live in peace and harmony with our surroundings? While it appears that many people are wise enough to see the insanity of continuing along this road, too many others fail to see and care how their behavior is affecting others. While our scientific knowledge increases, our failure to recognize our moral responsibility to future generations, does not cause me to be optimistic about the future, although I always have hope that we will change.

  ... I'd recommend the first 18 or 19 chapters to any sapient being.  However, apparently enamored by his own footwork (along with several thousand of his reviewers), Harari, seems to trip over his own hubris while rounding third base, leaping forward from a riveting, imaginative historical account, into his own notions of the present-becoming-future and dabbling in metaphysics enough to explain in purely reductionist terms the ultimate reality of the Universe and our place in it, sweeping aside any mystery as mere human delusion.  From a strictly scientific perspective I think the author would have to agree that we're just not able to define Homo sapiens, or the Kosmos, for that matter, objectively, while we're right in the middle of it all ... ....

  One of the best books i have ever read. It has more suspense than a suspense thriller, more dramatic than a drama, more truth than ancient wisdom, simple and very frank narration, insightful, scientific and imaginative than fiction. Yet, it is all about truth. A mundane subject as 'history' has been made into such an enjoyable reading with humour, suspense and drama and explained philosophies like no other religious scriptures. And the best part is that it is free from bias and only as matter of fact, without the author imposing any kind of opinion or view of his own on the reader. I will strongly recommend it to all and, if given an option, will make it a compulsory study in junior colleges all over the world. To a very great extent the facts presented demolish the myth of racism, casteism, and other man made discriminations and expose many beliefs. I am just itching to read the next book on Sapiens by Mr. Yuval Noah Harari. Thank you Mr. Harari for your contribution to humanity.

  This book has so much potential.  However, the author makes no secret of his general disdain for religion, and people who are religious.  While I can appreciate the premise that religion, nations, and even laws are a result of the human ability to formulate language around things that are not concrete - he goes overboard in his mocking of religious beliefs, and his tone whenever the topic of religion is approached.  I have read many books by atheist authors that I enjoyed, and I completely respect this worldview approach, especially considering the source.  But the disdain and general degeneration of religious beliefs, (an attitude the author does not share for those who believe in nation-states or the law,) is quite simply disrespectful.  The over-the-top comments regarding religion do nothing to further the author's arguments.

  A view at history from a different standpoint. The book is intensely interesting and surprisingly easy to read. It spans from the beginning or homo sapiens (cognitive perception) to present time. The question begs to be asked if progress over time and technology of the present will ultimately destroy our species to give way to a whole new cognitive being unrelated to mankind. We as humans sure didn't have much regard for the environment (nature and animals) along our so called human advances which is littered with greed and destruction. In the end, human's today aren't happier than the were several thousand years ago, despite our effort to do so. Every college should make this book part of their history curriculum. Very thought provoking.

  Countless manuscripts and books have been written of global and regional events/histories that define cultures, atrocities, technologies and humanities.  Sapiens must certainly be included among any erudite sampling of scholarly enlightenments reflective of an author filled with passion endowed steps into seminal understandings.Perhaps the author's final pages and thoughts preface all of the collective wisdom written on all of the other 400 pages as ethical conundrums are defined but without reposition.Firstly though author Harari assigns the biggest ecological tragedy of events to Sapiens, through colonization; farmers killed off, through a wave of extinction, species of birds, insects, and other island inhabitants and other ocean species never before threatened by outside forces.In chapter 20, The end of Homo Sapiens, we find that globally scientists are engineering new versions of life while ignoring natural laws.  Lab animals and farmyard animal brutalities and sufferings are forever expansionary and ubiquitous enabled by govt. grants into perpetuity.Today Sapiens are verging into God powered with creation and destruction abilities restrained only by a self defined divinity to infinity.Under the dominion of humanity we are now left with a legacy of ecological destruction, a world of immense human and animal suffering and displacements, plus a future of uncertainty for all creatures on planet earth.Indubitably.

  Harari describes how the technological revolution most disruptive of human sociality -- of empathy and caring and community building -- is not the modern explosion of the internet.  it was the Agricultural Revolution in Eur-Asia about 10,000 year ago -- the subject of Emile Durkheim's seminal study The Division of Labor in Society.  In the preface to the second edition, Durkheim stated that in complex society, people must find a way to create social solidarity based on those qualities Harari tells us had existed but were lost when hunter-gatherer society evaporated. Durkheim assumed a priori  that primitive societies were incapable of achieving it and that modern man must discover how to achieve it.  Harari challenges this assumption and its modern offshoots, notably set forth in Steven Pinker's recent book, The Better Angels of Our Nature.  Pinker presents anecdotal evidence  to support the conclusion that organic solidarity is probably beyond human reach hence we must all accept the modern Leviathan State (ala Thomas Hobbes) as the best option available for our thriving. Harare's much more compelling analysis suggests that early man did indeed possess organic solidarity, and lost it as the result of embracing a technology that allowed too much luxury and enabled an abandonment of accountability.  His analysis allows us to view the consequences of this abandonment as a crucial lessons of history; to infer that Durkheim was very probably correct in suggesting that without it we cannot ultimately thrive, but wrong in imagining that it originated with the Agricultural Revolution.  If modern man did not discover organic solidarity but abandoned it early on, and continues to do so to this day, this condition is not, as Pinker states, necessarily irreversible.  For those concerned about present political/economic andcultural trends, and about how to create an activism capable of effectively addressing them, Harari's work is crucial.  As a companion study, Chris Harmon's A People's History of the World is also invaluable.

  Insightful at times provocative, and generally grounded on a range of scientific research and reading. The book attempts to discuss the grand arches of humanity as it has existed over the last couple million years. Salient aspects of the book's thesis are:* Three ""revolutions"" have advanced humankind beyond any other species (Cognitive, Agricultural, Industrial)* These revolutions and humankind's intrinsic skills and abilities do not necessarily assure the species' eternal advancement* The underpinnings of human modern existence is based on a number concepts called ""myths"" which include money, religion and empire.Opinions about this book are divergent amongst my friends. Several, who I thought might enjoy it, have not read it. Others started the book but did not finish it. There were comments of the book being inadequately referenced (too much simply appeared to be the author's own ideas). The book's conclusion suggests humankind is on the brink of a post-evolutionary existence.I found the book easy to pick up again after not reading for a week, which fit well into my reading habits.One of the many good quotes: ""You could never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him limitless bananas after death in monkey heaven.”

  This book started out well but I lost interest in the 20th century. The promise of a new human species due to technology just didn’t connect with me. At times I felt I was reading something by a complete atheist and that is hard to reconcile with the majesty of creation. I have no problem with the concept of Homo sapiens outliving Neanderthals or occupying the planet at the same time. But either the author wished to remain neutral to all religious viewpoints, more likely he had no use for creation or God of any mankind. This took away from the interesting parts of the book.

  Finally, we are introduced to the facts ( in layman's terms) about the long, long existence of our pre-sapien predecessors and a fascinating stroll through the past 250,000 years or more of humans inhabiting our planet. I liked this book completely because it is well-researched, analyzed by experts and scholars of pre-history of our species. This depth of exquisite information which has now become knowledge is astounding for the uphill battle that's been waged against science by religious doctrine. Nowhere in this book is the idea that people are descended from other anthropoids -- apes and so on -- because other anthropoids are of a completely different species.Personally, I learned more about our predecessor beings by reading this, than I've learned from any other book on the subject. The consistency and scholarly method of expounding information and new knowledge about our unique species and our distant ancestors is a source of wonder.I recommend this book to anyone who would like to know more about our species and how we came to be what we are today, and the distinct possibilities explored about what our species may yet become.

  I was hesitating getting this based on some of the reviews, but I’m glad I did. Apparently opinions to some are now “facts presented in ways we don’t agree with or wish weren’t true.” The fact that our social creations have real world consequences is one of the major points of the book, while some reviewers have treated it as if that fact discredits the book itself. There is some speculation, but it’s not meant to be a scientific treatise. It’s an informal review of human history, and can lead to some interesting considerations. This is well worth the reading for that alone.

  Gives a very good high level overview of the history of humans and we came to be where we are now.But there are a lot of issues with this book, much of Harari’s analysis is opinion based and not backed up by data. His conclusions that sapiens were happier and more fulfilled as hunter-gatherers is very one sided. He argues that the agricultural revolution allowed more people to live under worse conditions, possibly true but he provides no evidence to back this up. He also argues that the first agricultural societies were miserable because they worked all day farming primarily one kind of food, and thus didn’t have a varied and rich lifestyle as hunter-gatherers did. But not everyone in the first agricultural societies were farmers, this allowed humanity to worry about things other than their next meal and gave them free time to make tools, develop languages and cultures at a faster rate than when humans were preoccupied running from bears and eating wild mushrooms.There are also several claims that are factually incorrect and are now proven as debunked myths.The first half reads as an unbiased history of mankind but after the agricultural revolution it becomes a biased social commentary. This book should be seen as a Wikipedia level summary of sapiens’ history, a good general overview, but gets some of the finer details glossed over or outright incorrect. For the finer details it’d be better to read up THAT Wikipedia summary, rather than this book as a summary of all summaries relevant to humanity.

There is a ton of information in this book, yet it is quite readable.  Dr. Harari definitely has an agenda.

As soon as I picked it up, I detected problems with assumptions behind statements and quality of analysis, especially in chapters dealing with economies and businesses.I don't necessarily disagree with some of the conclusions -- especially the first chapters. But the author gets further and further away from his field of expertise as the book progresses.A PhD from a top university should not put out books like this.

There is almost nothing new or interesting in his discussion of humanity and its history.  Other than a couple of new archeological sites referenced, all the information in this book was in my freshman courses 30 years ago.  But Harari weaved it all together well enough that it was still a good read.  If you don't know much about human evolution or the evolution of social and political organization, then a lot of this would be new and interesting.  His storytelling is great and in a couple of places he does an especially good job of taking the complex and boiling it down into a simple anecdote.It is a good read, just have the right expectations going in.

  For a history geek, this book is the ultimate source on pretty much everything.Right at the beginning of this book Yuval Noah Harari presents his central thesis, that Sapiens can rise to the top of the food chain and become the rulers of the world because of our ability to create fiction, fiction that can eventually unites us more than the maximum 150 member-band found in any other species.Unconventionally (or perhaps controversially) the fiction that Harari is talking about includes human rights charter, system of capitalism, system of communism, religion, caste system, border countries and its nationalism, all of which are not part of nature, are actually made up by humans, but can bring a large group of people together in their respective names.This, of course, is only one of the many fascinating revelations, arguments, and explanations about human history from the book. One argument in particular was mind blowing for me, that humans have several diferrent forms like Homo Sapiens, Neanderthals, etc just as dogs have different breeds and cats ranged from kitty cat to lions and tigers. And more intriguingly, Sapiens have eliminated all form of (competing) humans except for themselves.The book also provides the most concise history of the ancient era, polytheist religions, mercantilism, climate change, the science evolution, a very eye-opening history of capitalism, the condensed history of energy (which explains the industry better than Daniel Yergin’s long books), the most logical explanation on the current trend of consumerism which gives a surprise minimalism message, the best detailed explanation (and thus, the argument) on animal cruelty, and many more.Moreover, it even covers about diet and exercise (e.g. what hunter-gatherers actually eat and why it's different than the current crazed of paleo diet), one whole chapter on happiness that would make Gretchen Rubin proud, and gives a lot of new connections for previously thought separate occurrences, like how the Mississippi bubble eventually lead to the French Revolution, the 1821 Greek revolt against the Ottoman became the root of today’s Greek economic chaos, or who were behind the First Opium War and what the British initially use Hong Kong for.In short, it is a mind blowing (successful) attempt at covering everything there is about human history, in the best possible approach: in any topic Harari lay down all the many angles of arguments, presents all the facts from all sides, gives his carefully constructed opinion on the matter, but crucially still leaves the conclusion open-ended for further research. For these reasons, this book easily became the (newest) best book I’ve ever read, by a distinction. It gave me abundant new perspectives that directly change the way I see several things in life. No wonder that Many people from Bill Gates to Barack Obama highly recommend this book.

  With books such as these, you have to take what you can get from them. And there was much to take from this book. But... Some points raised were either incorrect or bizarre. For instance, the notion that hardly anyone dies from hunger is simply untrue, unless of course several millions each year equates to ""hardly anyone."" But that probably was just laziness on Harari's part. More of concen to me is his notion that if something is possible, it cannot be unnatural. The illogical conclusions that can be drawn from that are almost endless. I wonder if he was oblivious to the fact that such notions have contributed greatly to his summation of the world in which we live.

That is just me. The reader on the Audible book is excellent, and, depending on the reader, this book works both ways. This book covers the past, present, and future of humanity. It was all interesting. WhileI knew about the impact of the scientific revolution, I did not know about the impact on humans as we shifted to an agricultural society. So interesting. The writing is great, and this perspective of humanity is fascinating. The future is disturbing but in a totally intriguing way. If you like history and science merged, and you are curious about how human beings got to where we are today, I think you will like this book. I did.

  Those reviewers who focus on the book’s imprecisions are, I think, missing the point. Sapiens is a work of popular historical science. I put the emphasis on “popular historical.”  In 500 pages, Harari has put together a reasonably coherent history of people and some of the bases for being concerned about the future. One can certainly quarrel with Harari’s philosophical bent. However, this is not a doctoral dissertation. Rather, it is a fine primer/refresher on the subjects that Harari thumbnails as he tries to make sense of sapiens dominion over and destruction of the planet and other life forms. It is easy and accessible reading. If one is prompted by it to investigate some of those subjects via more rigorous sources, that is a good thing.

Amazes me how people fall for that hoax.  The other is the sad but true  realization that we are a cruel, self destructive species and we will be responsible for our own demise.

  This book works it's way through our society's development, starting about 70,000 years ago and going past present day. Along the way, the author makes several stops at pivotal revolutions including the cognitive, the agricultural, the scientific, and the industrial.I loved the ideas and questions about how we define progress, the root of some of society's challenges, and where it is that we want to go. One of my favorite ideas the author explored was the historical tendency for our beliefs to be quite fleeting on society's timeline.Unfortunately, I felt the author failed to take his own advice. He seemed more willing to accept that other people's beliefs were fallible myths than he was to accept the imperfect nature of his own beliefs. Maybe we all are a bit guilty of that.I felt the author was condescending towards Christianity. As a Christian myself, I can readily accept that as a people we have quite the imperfect record.  I also feel there is a place for constructive criticism. This, however, often times felt like the author was pontificating about something that he didn't understand terribly well.

  It's not often that I read a book that radically changes my perspectives.  Yuval does a great job framing historical, anthropological, societal, political and theistic perspectives in a way that enables to step one to view the world in a more productive way.  Just like day trading doesn't make sense for most people versus say, mutual fund investing, would be how I would view the way most people consider the world they're living in versus how they really should view it.  No absolutes in what Yuval espouses, but he creates a vessel that allows us to think more holistically about human life and human existence.  Homo Deus, his next book, does not disappoint on the heels of this one.

  Fascinating breakdown of the major shifts in human development. Traces the development of conceptual cognitive abilities, the discovery and effects of agriculture, the scientific revolution, and more. Written in an engaging style to keep reader interest. Speculation over the future prospects for the human race are fascinating. Vast amounts of history and anthropology covered. One weakness is the tendency to assume that because the human conceptual ability is constructive that it automatically cannot be true as well, which is why the author dismisses any truth is religion (or philosophies) as almost by definition, false (perhaps delusional, while nevertheless moderately useful at times). But while I appreciate the emphasis on recognizing that human conceptual realities are not obviously revealed in , say, biology, I nevertheless think that some form of the genetic fallacy is being toyed with here (i.e., because we probably know how humans came to believe something, therefore it is probably not an accurate belief, especially if tied to religious thought). But other than that, a rollercoaster of a good read.

  The author dares to take high altitude view (along with boots-on-the-ground examples) to observe whet are species came from, what is has done and the very scary questions as to where our species is going or going to end.Admittedly some parts of the book bring more value-added than others for an educated reader. Some parts may cause a tingle in your spine and others might be “tell me something I don’t know”, but over all this is a book that stands out and will continue to stand out in a very uncomfortable way.

  Not finished reading yet, but it gives a very humbling,disturbing view on what it is to be human and sapient. Starting in prehistory, he details the other Homo ( human) species that were living and thriving on Earth at the same time as Homo sapiens. Then traces the demise of all of them when the Sapiens(wise) humans showed up. Next comes the extinction of mega fauna as Homo Sapiens migrated into  new areas one after another and killed and ate them and utilized them for shelter and clothing. We are a scourge on the earth, over using and altering everything we come across!Now I'm reading how human societies evolved through eras of revolutionary ""progress"" creating cooperative myths to promote survival strategies.Fascinating but disturbing reading!

  One of the best books that I've read in a long time. Harari takes us on an anthropological history of humankind and discusses in detail why and how we have evolved the way we did -- especially on a cultural basis.The book is filled with innovative and fresh concepts that make you think. A couple notable examples include --The reason humans have evolved beyond our animal cousins is primarily due to our ability to create and perpetuate ""myths""Our coveted ideals of capitalism and democracy are no more based in truth than religion.Our search for happiness and meaning inevitably involves lying to ourselves. He certainly has an appreciation for Buddhist philosophy in regards to happiness.One refreshing aspect of his book is that it is not dogmatic and it is well balanced. Too many authors (for example, Jared Diamond of Guns, Germs, and Steel) come up with a central thesis and write hundreds of pages simply regurgitating their point using select historical examples.Instead, Harari presents many innovative theories and postulates, backs them up with both evidence as well as pokes holes in them as imperfect and not overarching.

  I tend not to give out many 5 star ratings but a book that causes me to question much of what I thought I knew, with an ability to place those ideas in a different context, and to generate even more questions is not one I would take lightly. As ""heavy"" as the content sounds, the writing is fluid, logical, and interesting. How did we, Sapiens, as a species come to dominate the planet? How, for example, did we extinguish the Neanderthals, they of the bigger brains and far more brawn? It started with the first of the revolutions discussed, the Cognitive and our ability to share fictitious myths and realities that do not exist, along with a penchant for gossip. Other revolutions followed, the agricultural, and the scientific. Interesting observation that  for billions of years the world changed by the slow process of evolution with little indication that there was any role played by ""intelligent design"" by in the last few hundred years, many changes have been caused by our own ""intelligent"" design. By many measures we have made enormous ""progress"", but I enjoyed the discussion as to whether this has made us happier. Also entranced by the discussion of ""The End of Homo Sapiens"" and the ""Animal that Became a God"" and the comment ""Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who don't know what they want?"" Enjoy the book and prepare to think. A tip of the hat also for the great production quality of the book with clay coated pages to permit the reproduction of quality images the tome itself has a bit of heft.

  15 years ago I’ve studied many history subjects concerning everything on the planet. Every little thing in this book reminds me about these studies. The immense amount of knowledge put to this book and given in the most easy way possible. Everything is in its place. It is a pleasure to read and than to discuss.It is a hard book for religious people and for those who have a notion of being the smartest guys on Earth.

  It's a rare treat to read a book that feels like a seismic shift in my life. Surprisingly, reading The Expanse was the last book I remember giving me that feeling. This book is a very different topic since it's a book about us; humans and their past, present and future.This is a remarkable book that analyzes the interconnected forces at play that drove human history to where it is today. From farming to capitalism to science to religion. We truly are a miracle of nature - awful and awesome.This is a book I wish every single person in the world would read. It really makes you see the world and humanity in a different light. Or, at least, in slightly different lights.One word of warning: this definitely triggered my existential angst.

  While the reader will need to discern for themselves among opinion, presumption, and verifiable fact, this is an original and informative though highly speculative sweep of human pre-history and history (from documents and artifacts) that is interesting to read. I used my year-end holiday to read it start-to-finish.  When I began it, I said to myself: ""Where's the footnotes for such sweeping assertions and generalizations?"".  But, as I continued to read, I became less uncomfortable and more amused.Topic list includes:The Big Bang, emergence of organisms, evolution, the genus Homo and its variants (including Homo Sapiens), the Cognitive Revolution, the Agricultural Revolution, early kingdoms, writing, money, religions and empires.  Scope includes every continent.  Later content includes the Industrial Revolution and informed, imaginative speculations about the future.

  This is one of the most overrated books in recent times! The science narrative is interesting, up to date and clear, but nothing extraordinary. Ok, it's a good science popularization book, like so many others.What I found really worrisome is the postmodern narrative about myths. For the author, everything is a myth. The American Constitution is a myth, at the same level as the Greek myth of Orion. The advantages of travelling, are just a romantic myth...Gosh! When scientists or scholars arrive at this point, what can we say? Maybe the author is also a myth!

  Harari is now part of the select group of top 10 writers, that I just cannot fathom how they have been able to understand so many disciplines, synthesize so much knowledge, connect the dots so magnificently, and then, be able to explain to the very lay audience all these wonders. Sapiens was a delight from page 1 to 416. Quite some uncomfortable truths to learn, even some that made me cry. And just an eye opener, and a trigger to ponder on humanity and see things with higher scrutiny and from more diverse angles.To me, Harari is as great an author as Dawkins, E.O. Wilson, Janine Benyus, Pollan, Matt Ridley, Jared Diamond, or the Heath brothers.

  Interesting take but a little aggravating.  His broad insights are clever and compelling but his voice is a little arrogant and dismissive.  He describes all philosophical constructs as myths and fiction yet seems to be unaware of his own value judgements which seep thru at every turn.  When illustrating concepts he makes lots of unnecessary minor factual errors that any novice historian should recognize.  For example, to dramatize horrific behavior he references the burning of witch’s in Salem MA when in fact no one was ever burned at the stake...they were hung.  While this may seem minor it’s still either bad or lazy scholarship and it happens often enough to make you question his other assertions.The book is still worth reading because his broad concepts offer an interesting and in some ways enlightening perspective on the modern world and the human condition.Also, I found having previously read The Blind Watchmaker by Dawkins and The Dragons of Eden by Sagan helped provide me a better foundational understanding of the mechanisms of evolution which I felt this author blew past a little too quickly.

  I really liked the exploration of early human species, and the description of how ideas and ideology over time have enabled people to work together as tribes, as civilizations, and transnationally. It's hard to get through the reading though when he illustrates all his points with absurdities and injustices in America rather than his own native country Israel. The book smarts with cultural superiority which is never stated forthrightly. I'm not a Christian but it still rubs me the wrong way when Christians are mocked and I'm a huge critic of US culture myself but Mr Harari, why don't you have a stab at critiquing your own nation's inconsistencies and moral failings? Then the author would come across as fair-minded. Geopolitics aside, it's a must-read (if you can put it aside at all)!

  Really terrific book. Harari is intelligent, thoughtful, really well-educated historian. He is a great communicator. Stick with the book - don't be put off by the sweeping generalizations. There is content which will make you re-think your worldview. Some detail is controversial and some seems wrong to me - specifically his claim that Darwin came up with the theory of evolution before Wallace, a claim I suppose would be thought generally true but specifically Wallace's paper showed up in Darwin's hands BEFORE Darwin had published a single thought about evolution; I would like to have seen a tip of Harari's hat to Wallace - but that's just me trying to level a class-prejudiced 19th century Britain and Darwin's subtle but questionable manipulation of publishing priority.

  There are many research books and articles referenced in this book, but ultimately, the conclusions stated in the book book are entirely subjective (like this review itself).I expected, somehow, an unbiased study of humankind based on some types of concrete evidence.  This book, in my opinion, takes circumstantial evidence and draws life-changing (literally) conclusions.Please understand that I am negative and cynical and mostly agree with what the author says.  However, even I am no as negative and cynical as he appears.I have gleaned from him: Homo sapiens are smarter than all other animals; we’ve killed or enslaved all other animals; we have inadvertently enslaved ourselves to ourselves, so our future (in our current state) is fatal.  There you go:  a brief synopsis of “A Brief History of Humankind”.

  This was definitely not a Christian book.  The author comes at this through a evolutionary perspective.  So be warned.  But the book is highly interesting and plain fascinating.  In what I do, one of the core skills is understanding human behavior, the book talks about this dynamic throughout history.  You do see what makes humans different and special.  I loved this quote.  ""A chimpanzee can’t win an argument with a Homo sapiens, but the ape can rip the man apart like a rag doll.""  We can argue and think together.  There are numerous topics that are interesting like the role of gossip in facilitating coorperation, and the role of myth in uniting people.  Over and over again, there were insights that caused me to think.  One topic was intersting which was the role of the alpha in the tribe.  It was not through strength, but through other skills.  This book is full of insight.  I like this one.  ""One of history’s few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and to spawn new obligations.""  We all struggle with ""lifestyle drift.""  There is talk about the role of diplomacy.  ""A single priest often does the work of a hundred soldiers – far more cheaply and effectively.""  It is better to talk than to fight.  You will totally disagree with a lot in the book, but the book will make you a wiser person in understanding human nature.  It was a deep and thought provoking read.

The author jumps to conclusions based on pure hypotheticals and unproven claims as if the reader should just accept them as they are presented. The worst part is that because this is written by a professor or someone with letter after their name, people will just assume what he writes is true or that he knows what he's talking about, which he doesn't.

  As an anthropological history, this book is easy to follow both for its simplicity of style and for its interesting take on man's development. I do have some reservations about his assertions about the origins of being, about the all exclusive role of evolution and the complete dismissal of any causal agent. Blind development is all that is necessary to explain everything. I would have spent some time on the spiritual history of man, a good chapter perhaps. His belief in another form of homo sapiens, perhaps a homo sapiens sapiens as an inevitability, to me is not all that convincing. Sticking chips in a brain is just that, another appliance to aid the essential man.It may be that he has saved more cogent arguments for his next book, Homo Deus.

  This book is a very interesting “travelling” along the story of Homo sapiens. We should be grateful to the author by trying, in a relatively short book, to give us an account of the fantastic odyssey of humanity from its very beginnings. It is vividly written, which helps to keep the interest of the reader during most of the time.None book can be neutral towards the forces and movements that have moulded the course of history. It is also difficult to resist the temptation of making backward judgements, as it is impossible to avoid that the realities are interpreted according to the particular bias of each author. This one is no exception. Under this light must be accepted some positions defended in the book, as, for example, the allegation that the transition from foragers to farmers (the Agricultural Revolution) represented a degradation in the quality of life of each particular individual, or the ensuing comment that Homo sapiens has been domesticated by wheat, rice or potatoes, rather than the inverse. This is a concession to the animistic vision of the world which, in a different context, the author well defines.The author does not resist the temptation to look into the future. He foresees that, with all the astounding scientific and technological breakthroughs, our inheritors will be godlike. Leaving aside the contradiction in terms that the idea involves, this would be the final feat of the adventurous sapiens: to annihilate God, or the gods, by engulfing them.

  This is a fascinating book. Probably the best I read in years. Harari managed to write a page turner out of a huge amount of research about Homo Sapiens. Human evolution it turns out is not only about intelligence. What made humans the dominant species is their unique ability to band together and make powerful entities that dominates their environment. Mr Harari also delves into several aspects of our lives. What are the roots of happiness? Are we happy? where is our evolutionary path leading us? To answer these questions and others he delves into several areas of science and technology. You may not agree with some of his conclusions. But he raises many questions about our history and the price paid by other species by our unchecked dominance. What is surprising is how the author turns all this research into a story that you cannot put down. But unlike fiction, this a story you relate to. Highly recommended.

  The book is full of the author attempting to discredit everyone else as false and then tries to give his opinions as truth. The text is full of speculation and fantasy and has no real scientific value. At most, I would think someone with his education would attempt to present facts, not try to pass his opinions as truth. Some historical facts that are true but not impressed by the book. The author has some twisted views of life, from thinking it would be thrilling to have sex with animals to some far-fetched theories, which lead me to question the character and values of the author. Nevertheless, to his credit, he did manage to get this book to be a best-seller, which leads me to question what people are thinking. As Harari said in his book the majority are usually wrong, and it is true to say about his own book.

  Sapiens is a fascinating and sobering journey through the evolution of our species. From our beginnings, as just one of many species on the planet, our cognitive awakening, agricultural, scientific, and industrial revolutions, we’ve come a long way. I’m not sure if we are any better off, happier, or healthier than our hunter gather forebears, but they certainly were tougher and more self-reliant than we are. We are also the most destructive species on the planet with little regard for other species or the environment. This book is not all doom and gloom, our species has a rich, complicated history and we have done a lot in the last 2.5 million years. I highly recommend this book!

  This is certainly one of the most interesting books that I have read in recent years.In this brief account, the author covers the full span of human history, from the time when we Sapiens coexisted with other human species under the Homo genus, including Neanderthals and others, up to the present day.  By focusing his discussion around three revolutions--cognitive, agricultural, and industrial--he is able to give a vivid account of human history since the beginning.The author is an historian, but thankfully does not write like an academic.  His writing style is lively and easy to read.  HIs book reflects thorough research. His comments are to the point, and analysis thoughtful and convincing.  Whether one agrees with his points of view or not, this book is a joy to read.

  This is a great book on what it means to be human. I was hoping for more of an anthropological history of man. And clearly the author has never spent time in the wild. How else can you propose our hunter gatherer ancestors were less stressed?  In the wild we are still not at the top of the food chain.  The author reminds the reader we are animals when convenient but down plays that fact when trying to explain our social structure. Animals do as animals need to do. And as we sit on the cusp of great things in science we butcher each other over religion and perceived slights. We are still animals and our social saw though fantasies we create for order, are still the product of our own basic needs and wants.The best part  of the book is it challenged my thinking regarding modern society and the current state of mankind. But I was hoping for a not thorough investigation of the history of honor sapiens. I'm that regard there was more of the author's own hypothesized suppositions than anthropological fact.Definatly worth the time to read and if your honest with your own thoughts, will challenge your views.

  I found this book while searching for my next read. I was looking for something that would give me an overview of the entirety of known human history. I must say, I was not disappointed. Writing a book like this is no simple task, however I feel that Harari handled it exceptionally.The first third of the book is amazing. Harari paints a vibrant image of hunter-gatherer life, showcasing not only the pragmatic aspects of daily living, but also the theological and societal viewpoints of these early hominids.Before starting the book, I noticed many irate commentators on here grieving the author's more opinionated segments in parts of the book. I read it anyway, as I am reading a book; I want to hear the author's opinion. Many people seem very disturbed by Harari's argument of the Agricultural Revolution being detrimental to overall human happiness. First of all, this is not the first book to have these kinds of theories. (Ishmael, anyone?) And secondly, it makes me wonder... Did these provoked commentators even read the thing?One thing Harari does wonderfully here is that he presents opposing arguments for nearly everything. He explains why the advent of farming was beneficial as well as detrimental. He'll make you think twice about the Nazis and then in the next paragraph he'll almost make you understand their viewpoint (before bashing it yet again). These controversies are indeed a part of human history, and the book would not be complete without dedicating some thought to the logic behind them.Harari covers everything from Neanderthals to railroads, to slave ships sold on the stock exchange, from capitalism, to communism, from China to Europe, from Aztecs and the Spanish to factory farming and artificial intelligence. It's really a gallimaufry of everything we've ever collectively done. Is every single thing covered? Of course not. Did he fail to mention your particular country's day of independence? Maybe. A hell of a lot of other things were mentioned however, and it was a truly enjoyable read that sparked a couple of other interests due to its myriad content and subject matter. Not to mention I learned a thing or two. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a basic outline of homo sapiens progress throughout time.

  I found the beginning to be a great read, but then it slowed down in the last third. The author is overtly politically correct, and therefore leaves out large area of possible history in human history. It wouldn't be so bad, except the author tells you they are not going to discuss half of the possible outcome. So I can't really take this as a scientifically book, it's an opinion of what the author wants to discuss.

  Harari gives us a new perspective that may be as important to this current cohort of Sapiens as Darwin and Marx were to our recent past. Kondratioff cycles pale by comparison. The moving finger does indeed move, but intentionality is apparently not in control. In the immortal words of Firesign Theater we are all bozos on this bus, with none but bozos to do the steering. Well, for the time being. The imposition of an evolved driver is already upon me: I had to fight keep the auto-correct from mangling my intentions. Yet it unhelpful lyrics did not spell check Kondratioff. Unhelpfully.  See what I mean. People of the world unite; the reins are slipping from our fingers.

  Sad to see, that is, that such a remarkable work becomes yet another battlefield in the war between the right and left. I hold a graduate degree in the earth sciences and am something of an amateur historian. When I read reviews stating that this book isn't based on research, is opinion disguised as history, and not worth reading, I am filled with despair over the state of our dis-union. What separates bare historical fact from true historical exposition is analysis and interpretation, which is precisely what Harari gives us in Sapiens. He connects the dots and does so with style and grace and insight into the human condition. This is what Gibbon did in the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, and Thucydides in his exposition of the Peloponnesian War. Alas, like the Greeks of third century B.C., we Americans are at war with each other and seemingly cannot agree on anything. Scholarship is especially suspect. If a work of history yields a glancing blow to one's political mindset, then it must be denounced, lest truth gain a foothold. Everything is interpreted through biased eyes and nothing is ever seen for what it actually is.Yes, sad to see.

  After reading this book, I really got the sense that it wasn’t just the dis-united States of America that was so messed up, it was the entirety of our whole human species. And this book was published before the Trump presidency. There are a lot of unique insights, but don’t expect it to be uplifting. I’m not too surprised that it comes from the point of view of an atheist. Far-right Christians may have a hard time swallowing the content of this book. Even though I was raised Christian and conservative, I’m not far right and consider myself open to opinions different from my own. However, if you are very conservative, I would recommend following up this book with Cosmic Justice by Thomas Sowell.

  Yarari has a talent for taking history and combining it with simple, digestible concepts, mixed with futurism and his studies on happiness, and turning it all into something that changes the way that his readers view the world. I read this book about one year ago and it has continued to stand as one of the most impactful books that I have ever read. I went on to read ""Homo Deus"" and have plans to read his new book once it becomes available. I recommend this book to friends, and my wife is currently reading it and wanting to talk about the ideas from the book. It is incredibly mind-expanding and has a way of provoking meaningful questions within a person. It's a must-read.

  The first part gives an interesting overview of prehistoric humans. As soon as it turns to the agricultural revolution though the book becomes something other than what it promises. The author endlessly repeats the same idea that human society and cooperation, and thus supremacy, is only possible by “inter-subjective” myths. Any political, theological, legal, national, or other creation of the human mind is by definition a myth but at the same time our belief in those myths allows us to organize and build empires. This has the ring of sophistry. Just because a human mind creates something doesn’t mean it is a myth or in some sense untrue. I suggest the author take a course in metaphysics and become familiar with the last 300 years of thought regarding how we know what is true. I also got the impression the title was trading on Hawkings’ A Brief History if Time to sell more copies, but does not in any real sense resemble that book. After getting through about a third of the book it became intolerable and I gave up. Unfortunately I couldn’t return it because it had been 9 days since purchase and outside of the one week return window. I gave it two stars simply for the first few chapters which were interesting.

  The book is well written and overall interesting, but as someone who purchased it with the hope of reading how Homo Sapiens beat out the other groups of humans, I was pretty disappointed. Only about the first third of the book was related to homo sapiens and the differences between sapiens and other species. However, the last two thirds completely focused on just sapiens and the author's view of how humans came into the modern era. He covered topics from religion, to faith in money. He spent too much time discuss how sapiens evolved into our modern selves and how our modern economies and governments work. It seemed to say a long time ago there were many types of groups that fell under the homo genus, we're not sure exactly why there's only 1 today. Let's just focus on the 1 group today and what they're doing now. It really didn't delve deep enough into the comparative differences or advantages of sapiences vs. the other species.

  This book is an interesting and thought provoking history of mankind and how it has evolved. The Author glosses over how/why Mankind have managed to evolve differently from other animals but explains very well what those differences are. The book is at its core quite depressing, especially the last chapter when he speculates how Mankind will evolve in the future -  I don't want to be around!To me, the book raised the question that goes to the core of our existence. Are we only animal? In which case we will likely destroy ourselves by war, environmental catastrophe, plague, or all of that. Or have we a spiritual side, which will enable us to choose a different path based on care, shared resources, and sustainable living with Nature.

  I was disturbed to learn that in Harari's new book, Homo Deus, he ponders how future technologies will reshape humanity. This is a topic that Harari, a scholar of 15th century military history, is not especially qualified to discuss. If you’re into science fiction, read science fiction, not Harari.To demonstrate how off-base Home Deus is likely to be, allow me to dwell on the penultimate chapter of Sapiens, as it deals with modern biology and neuroscience, my areas of expertise, to illustrate the superficiality of Harari's arguments. His examples of this brave new world in which we now live are curated from the most sensationalist science reporting. He talks of the art-project rabbit, Alba, designed to express a green fluorescent protein. He also mentions the famous ""Vacanti mouse"" with what looks like a human ear growing on its back (in fact, this is cartilage that has been grown inside an ear-shaped mold and implanted into a mouse's back--sort of neat, but only slightly more impressive than stapling something shaped like an ear to the back of a mouse). These are two odd examples, as they aren't really reflective of current cutting edge science but are perfect examples of what might morally outrage someone who does not clearly understand what they really are. What?! An artist can just make a designer rabbit? No, an artist didn't make the rabbit. What?! Is that a human ear growing on a mouse's back? No. It isn't, it's a thing shaped like an ear that someone implanted in a mouse.Harari’s view of contemporary biology and neuroscience are more shaped by The Matrix and Jurassic Park than real academic research. Here is an example, ""A team of Russian, Japanese, and Korean scientists has recently mapped the genome of ancient mammoths, found frozen in the Siberian ice. They now plan to take a fertilized egg-cell of a present-day elephant, replace the elephantine DNA with a reconstructed mammoth DNA, and implant the egg in the womb of an elephant."" He lazily, and incorrectly, cites an article from Time magazine as his source. This, in fact, is not what the article is about, and almost everything in that quote is untrue. This team did not sequence the mammoth genome, they would not use fertilized eggs of recipients, and they would not use reconstructed mammoth DNA (as the technology does not exist to synthesize a mammoth genome from scratch). Instead, they hoped to find living mammoth cells containing an entire intact genome, then inject the nucleus of such a cell into an unfertilized elephant egg, hope it starts dividing, and implant that into an elephant womb. Here are the unknowns with respect to this task—the probability of finding mammoth cells that are thousands of years old but still have fully intact nuclei (impossible to estimate, but improbably small), the success rate of any elephant egg dividing after being injected with mammoth DNA (the rate for division after living mouse-to-mouse egg nuclear transfer is only a few percent), the probability that this nuclear-transfer derived egg would continue to divide after being implanted in an elephant womb (improbably small). In short, the captive population of elephants is too small to provide enough donor eggs and potential surrogate mothers to even consider performing this foolhardy project, yet, Harari, with his head full of ideas that he misunderstood from Time, seems to think that it’s just a matter of months before the mammoth will be resurrected. (I should note that, since the publication of Sapiens, several labs have found ways to investigate the function of individual mammoth genes inside modern elephant cells—but to say that this is recreating a mammoth is more extreme than saying that Alba, the fluorescent rabbit, is a perfect reconstruction of a jellyfish).Similiarly, Harari cites George Church's claim that he could make a Neanderthal child for $30 million. For the same reasons, the technology does not exist to synthesize a 3+ billion base genome de novo. At current DNA synthesis costs, it would require $100 million to carry out this synthesis as thousands or millions of fragments, which then couldn't be coherently assembled into something like a genome. No multicellular organism has ever been created with a synthetic genome, and human embryos would be the last place to start testing the possibility. Whether this is something that may eventually be technically possible is not important, as there are so many ethical hurdles to even begin the proof-of-principle research that it’s safe to say this isn’t going to happen unless someone first clones Josef Mengele and installs him as the head of the National Institutes of Health. I assume that Harari believes that since humans are so cruel as to practice industrial farming, it is inevitable that they will permit hundreds or thousands of failed pregnancies to relish in the glory of a Neanderthal. Again, Harari ignorantly suggests that the question is not whether this is possible but how many days until there is a new underclass of Neanderthals.Harari’s inability to discern science fiction from science fact extends into the world of neuroscience. He writes, ""Yet of all the projects currently under development, the most revolutionary is the attempt to devise a direct two-way brain computer interface that will allow computers to read the electrical signals of a human brain, simultaneously transmitting signals that the brain can read in turn."" He then supposes that in the very near future, people will be able to store their minds on external hard drives, and all human minds can be linked to form a super brain. While the quoted sentence is superficially true, it is not revolutionary. It should come as a surprise to no one that there are techniques like EEG and MRI that can crudely measure brain activity. It is also true that localized magnetic stimulation can affect one’s brain and even make someone perceive flashes of light. If you hook an MRI up to a computer which is, in turn, hooked up to a magnet on someone's head, you have made the technology that can make one person’s brain activity make another person see a flash of light. That is a stupid parlor trick and not something to fear.Now let’s consider Harari’s extension of this gimmick--- the notion that we could record someone’s mind. Current brain recording technologies amount to something like a Fitbit for your brain--an EEG or MRI can crudely determine when and how much your brain is active. Harari seems to believe that technology soon will exist permitting complete brain-state knowledge. Imagine if a device could record the state of every cell of your brain. First, you would never want such a device implanted into your own head, because it would consist of 100 billion pins stabbing into your brain and would kill you. Second, the output of this machine would be completely useless. A recording of all of the activity of every brain cell for the entirety of someone’s life would be a bunch of numbers, would represent a minuscule portion of the information processing that the brain actually does, and is impossible, anyways. To speculate about what this means about humanity is to waste one’s time.I have not yet completed Homo Deus, but I find it to be more well cited and more cautious than Sapiens. Nonetheless, I continue to find that his standard argument structure is: ""X is not technically impossible; therefore, X is inevitable."" When he rightfully notes that experts argue that genetically engineered babies or human-level AI are distant possibilities, he dismisses this as short-sightedness and argues that what scientists really mean by ""distant"" is ""a few years."" After all, he argues, when he first encountered the Internet in 1993, he didn't appreciate how great it would be in 2017. Is it just me, or is this comparison a bit arrogant? A modern-day neuroscientist's understanding of what is realistically possible in the field of artificial intelligence is the same as high-school-aged Harari's understanding of what the internet would be like in 25 years? This implies that high-school-aged Harari was a scholar of computer science and its history.He speculates that a la carte selection of the traits of your offspring is the near-certain next step from any DNA-editing-based correction of illness or disease. This seems to assume that the risk-to-reward ratio of correcting Hungtington's disease via gene editing is similar to that of eliminating freckles via gene editing. While Harari argues that it is a slippery slope leading from the former to the latter, one could argue that the latter is one-million times less practical or morally acceptable. The slope is both long and shallow to the extent that Harari's belief in the inevitability of commonplace cosmetic human genetic engineering arising from efforts to correct disease is like saying that birth control is dangerous because it will inevitably lead to widespread incest.Harari is somewhat engaging, but I can't help but find his overgeneralizations irksome.  When Harari talks about cutting-edge neuroscience, more often than not, he cites a newspaper or a website rather than a peer-reviewed publication. Then, he often paraphrases the part of the article in which a researcher wildly speculates about the future implications of her research as if it is a subject of active investigation. He glides along from topic to topic so that it becomes difficult to discern fact from wild prediction. This is a troubling trend as it makes the pursuit of knowledge about the function of genes or the organization of the brain seem like part of a nefarious, soon-to-be-realized plot to design an immortal class of cyborg elites.

  This book is a mixed bag.  It has three parts.  The first is a review of some of the concepts explored in Harari's earlier book Sapiens.  It elaborates on the fascinating concept of  ""intersubjective reality"", whereby concepts that are shared in our collective imagination have great power to shape our objective reality; examples given include money, corporations, pop-culture brands, and religions.  Part 1 is engaging and insightful, and deserves 4/5 stars.Part 2 is a critique of what Harari calls ""humanism"".  He really dislikes humanism: he inaccurately states its tenets, and then repeatedly mocks it (for example, as promoting indulgent consumerism and sex).  He claims that humanism is what is giving rise to an emerging cybernetic dystopia, described in Part 3.Harari is abusing the word ""humanism,"" as a canvas on which to paint his caricature of modern liberal culture (""liberal"" in the classical sense, not in the sense of left-wing politics).  He is not really interested in what humanist writers and philosophers have actually said, and does not reference their works.  He claims that humanism promotes the belief in a supernatural free will (when in fact, humanists value agency and freedom, but have differing opinions on free will).  He claims that humanism believes in an indivisible self/soul (when in fact, psychologists since Freud have a different understanding).  And he claims that humanism believes that individuals always know best about their own needs (when in fact, many have emphasized the importance of education in our development--he does not even reference John Dewey).  Harari also co-opts related terms that already have other established meanings, such as ""evolutionary humanism"" and ""liberal humanism"".If you want to understand humanism or other social-political movements of the 19th and 20th centuries, Harari will lead you astray.  Part 2 deserves only 2/5 stars.Part 3 is a dire prediction for humanity's future, as genetic engineering, AI, and human-machine interface technologies advance.  Harari gives several scenarios, each of which are described very plausibly as future extrapolations of current trends.  These scenarios are thought provoking and disturbing--we as a society should be taking them more seriously.  There is an interesting discussion of an emerging religion/ideology of ""dataism"", wherein moral worth depends on the ability to enhance data flow, rather than on consciousness.  Part 3 deserves 4/5 stars.For most of the book, Harari appears to be adopting a materialistic perspective, and one which is also extremely unsentimental and discounts the significance of human morale and character.  He pretends to assume that human beings are nothing more than algorithms.However, some of his arguments (against the existence of an indivisible self, against free-will) are similar to those in Buddhism.  He also discusses how animals and people have consciousness and subjective experiences, and presumes that artificial intelligence will remain unconscious (the ""weak AI"" hypothesis of John Searle).And on the very last page, he makes us wonder if his hardcore materialistic perspective has just been a long, extended ruse:  he asks us to question a worldview that would deny the significance of consciousness.  So it seems likely that in a future book he will focus on the nature of consciousness, and argue for non-theistic Buddhism (an understated agenda in Harari's writing--perhaps he thinks that this is the way for humanity to avoid the grim fate predicted here?).The reader concerned about techno-dystopia may also be interested in ""Weapons of Math Destruction,"" by Cathy O'Neil.[Update 6/13/2017:  see the comment below, by kaiser100, for further insight into Harari's perspective on consciousness and meditation.  The comment begins with ""Harari indeed believes that developing an understanding of consciousness, a science of mind, or however else one wishes to phrase it is the best and perhaps the only way to avert the grim fate that threatens humanity in this century.""]

  This is a thought-provoking book, that provides a set of questions and issues to focus on when  thinking about the shape of the future of humanity. Harari's starting point is that since humanity is no longer limited in major ways by the traditional curses of famine, epidemic and war, then humanity can more ambitiously take on projects,  like longevity, that would have appeared god-like to earlier generations.  But on the other hand, the technology that has enabled so much improvement in the quality of life  also threatens mass unemployment because of quantum improvements in artificial intelligence and computing power. This could create an existential problem for humans: if their labor is not required for the economy, what are people good for?The author does a very good job of describing the changes that science of technology have had on culture and society.  But at the same time, he undervalues the contributions and role of religion and philosophy.  His thesis is that the traditional theistic religions like Judaism, Christianity and Islam have been supplanted by ""humanism.""  This is interesting, but unless you are a fundamentalist Christian, secular philosophies like humanism or Marxism are not religions.  For Harari, religions are about organizing society, but there are many other non-social functions that religion performs that are not addressed by political philosophy such as transcendent meaning, the nature of the divinity and  potential access to the divine.  He also narrowly sees Judaism, Christianity and Islam as religions that seek answers in their sacred books (again like a fundamentalist caricature), when in fact those religions rely heavily on interpretation and post-scriptural scholarship and traditions, which evolve over time.  Just imagine how much you would be missing of the  three Abrahamic faiths if you looked only at the Tannakh (or Old Testament), the New Testament and the Koran.Harari points out that humanism is being challenged by scientific findings that undermine basic understandings of the self (such as there is a unitary ""me"" that has free will). In fact these beliefs have been challenged for centuries by both philosophy and religion.  Harari also makes the assumption that the mind is the same as the brain.  This has been a thorny problem in philosophy for generations, because knowing all about brains  does not give us access to the subjective experience of what it is like to be another person.  Likewise he dismisses the soul as a fiction, but since the soul is non an empirical entity, it cannot be disproved by empirical science.

  How do I dislike Homo Deus? Let me count the ways.1. Loved Sapiens. This is a disappointing sequel2. Authorial voice couldn’t be trusted. Was he advocating a point of view? Being a neutral reporter? Or something more devious? Midway through the book I started mistrusting him as an author, and his last sentences—asking the reader whether the materialist worldview he’d been touting throughout the book might be wrong—confirmed that he wasn’t trustworthy.3. Attack on humanism. He describes humanism as an ideology based solely on feelings (“it’s wrong to kill someone because it makes the victim feel bad”—I’m not kidding; this is what he says is humanism’s position). What about the various declarations of inalienable human rights that have been proclaimed over the last centuries, including the right to life? He doesn’t bother to discuss this.4. Never really nails down a discussion of an issue. Just says the same thing in various ways and moves on. Doesn’t give arguments against some of his most basic claims, e.g. humans are just algorithms. Which again is why it’s so startling when he asks the reader, at the end of the book, to ponder if maybe we aren’t algorithms.5. Doesn’t seem to grasp that today’s image of the universe as an algorithm is just as much rooted in our present-day understanding as when some centuries ago people spoke of the ‘clockwork universe.’6. ‘The system.’ He regularly speaks of something he calls ‘the system’ that is controlling things, but he never says what he means by this. He comes off like some 60’s hippie in the U.S. calling the government ‘the man’ and blaming everything on ‘the man.’7. The title. He never delivers. Calling the book Homo Deus makes you think he will investigate the various ways that humans might upgrade themselves. I got weary of his endless repetition of humanity’s supposed goal of immortality, bliss, and divinity. He should have spent less time in the preface promoting this trinity and more time in the third section discussing it. When he finally gets around to talking about the future, he skips lightly over the possibility of upgraded humanity to get to the more alarming idea of the end of humanity. The book should have been called Homo Extinctus.8. I could go on, but why? If you want to read more about the flaws of this book, read some other 3-star reviews.

  Like so many others have said here, this is nowhere near as accomplished as his first book. There doesn't appear to be any coherent narrative and the author seems to have expended all of his best ideas in his first piece of work. Such a huge let down because I loved his first book.

  First of all, let me say I loved Sapiens - a 5 star book in my opinion.  Homo Deus receives 3 stars from me for two primary reasons. One is related to expectations - I truly expected Homo Deus to be as good as Sapiens, but came away disappointed.  While the writing remained fresh, informative, yet clear in Homo Deus as with Sapiens, the former deals much more with our future than Sapiens did.  As a result, Homo Deus contains a great deal of the author's conjecture of what might happen in the future versus the more grounded and factually based Sapiens that applies the author's interpretation to what actually happened in our past.  So this second reason - a less fact based work of non-fiction as compared to Sapiens - is the primary of driver of my three star review.  I found the author's arguments to be compelling in Sapiens; in Homo Deus I felt factual backing for the author's positions for our future was not as convincing.  I do wonder had I not read Sapiens what I would have thought of this book standalone.

  Yuval Noah Harari interpreted our past history on “Sapiens.” Humans have dominated this world by gaining ability to cooperate in very flexible ways with countless numbers of strangers, and by creating intersubjective entities, through the Cognitive Revolution, the Agricultural Revolution, and the Scientific Revolution. “Homo Deus” is a sequel to this well-read book. We had lost instinctive sensitivity necessary for our survival during the three Revolution. Instead, we have developed our society relying deeply on each other’s individualities. With a help of intersubjective entities we have maintained much larger scale of society than animals. After succeeding in controlling famine, plague and war, humanity’s next targets seem to be acquiring immortality, happiness and divinity. Biotechnology and AI is likely to turn Homo sapiens into “Homo Deus” in the twenty-first century. But, at the same time, the age of the masses might be over. Only limited person can upgrade themselves into super-human. Harari illustrates the future possibility by citing familiar explanations. His knowledge covers widely from biology to economics. As science developed, our boundary against other living creatures has become obscured. Our illusion about the soul and consciousness, which distinguishes ourselves from other species, is staggering to severe scrutiny from science. To begin with, who are we? What’s the meaning of our existence in this world? Where do we plan to go? Reading “Homo Deus” presses us for an answer to these fundamental questions. The powers of biotechnology and computer algorithms is powerful enough to put Sapiens aside the evolutionary road. The idea that humans will always have a unique ability beyond the reach of non-conscious algorithms has become a mere pipe dream. Two options are open for modern Homo Sapiens, techno-humanism and data religion. However, Harari predicts techno-humanism may end up downgrading humans, even if we succeed in upgrading our bodies and our brains. When Dataism conquer the world, Harari foresees humanity turning out to just a ripple within the cosmic data flow. Are organisms/life really just algorithms/data processing respectively? Do we regard intelligence more valuable than consciousness, or vice versa? What kind of impact non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms cause on our society, politics and our daily life? To tackle with these problems, Harari suggests us to think and behave in new ways, which is free from constraint of present-day ideologies and social systems. The only way for us to come through the severe competition with algorithms would be, as Harari says, to keep learning throughout our lives, and to invent ourselves repeatedly.

  In antiquity, a prophet was a person who could see the hand of God moving in history. Dr. Harari leads us to redefine ‘prophet’ as a historian who sees the hand of technology moving in history. This is a compelling and very well-written book.  I received it in the mail from amazon.com at noon and finished it the next day at 4 PM. Although I ordered both of his books, this one came first and as a long-retired professor of ancient history, Western art and culture, and Classical civilizations, I simply could not resist its sub-title: A Brief History of Tomorrow.  The book is a thorough exploration of the economic and religious currents driven by the accelerating advance of technology in our time. The world today is a largely free market capitalist economy worshipping the religion of secular humanism. This pair has brought Homo Sapiens to for the first time since the invention of agriculture and hence civilization, to a world largely free of famine, plague, and war. What’s to conquer next, death? Can we become Homo Deus, or will the technology we must depend on to achieve that goal get ahead of us and itself sit in the driver’s seat of history as a new religion of Dataism? One could easily mine this 400 page book for a 200 page book of pithy one-liners. My favorite, perhaps because I long taught this in my classes was: “Radical Islam poses no serious threat to the liberal package, because for all their fervor the zealots don’t really understand the world of the twenty-first century, and have nothing relevant to say about the novel dangers and the opportunities that new technologies are generating all around us.” They are blindsided by the very modernity they reject, and it will leave them behind like the Madhist rebellion and its Islamic state in the Sudan in the late 1900s was left behind. Sure, they will kill a lot of Westerners and many more Middle Easterners, but they too will pass into oblivion. This book is a must read for the historian, the theologian, and the technologist. Unlike Alexander Graham Bell, we will not one day say: “What hath God wrought,” but rather “What have we wrought.”Peter C. Patton, Ph.D.

  No one can fault Yuval Noah Harari for lack of ambition.  This book attempts to assess where the human species is headed in the millennia to come.  Whether you think it succeeds or not will depend a lot on how many of the author's sweeping assumptions ring true for you. He assumes, for example that humans are beyond religion (God is dead, he says, it's just taking a long time to remove the body); that algorithms will make most jobs obsolete; that most people will become redundant for any societal purpose; and that the ones who don't will be god-like creatures who have used their wealth to bio-engineer themselves into continued relevance.  He makes interesting and mostly convincing arguments for all of this and a lot more.  It's a tour de force of creative behavioral forecasting even if the end point is a frightening dystopia that you may not want to live to see. Despite the dubious theme, the book contains a prodigious amount of fascinating information on where humanity has been and where it is going which is presented in a quick-paced, lucid narrative.  Well worth reading even if you come away not totally convinced.

  I enjoyed ""Sapiens"" and was looking forward to this logical follow-on as a reasoned projection of our species potential into the future.But this book didn't do it for me. It seems to dwell mostly (again) on how we got the way we are, with a little bit on our current challenges like ownership of the fate of Earth's climate.Following the definitions of Amazon's star-rating system, I had to select the simple ""I don't like it"" option.

  In his ambitious, albeit audacious book, Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow, Yuval Noah Harari labors to map out the landscape of humanity’s new frontier in the twenty-first century. Readers whose interests are perked by the title, however, are sure to be disappointed; Harari comes to few positive conclusions about what our future holds. That is, he predicts nothing concrete about what our future will be, even while offering little hesitation about sharing what he believes our future will not be: i.e., anything like our past.The initial claim of the book is rather straight-forward: God is dead, and humanity is like the dog that finally caught the car, and now has to decide what to do with it. The world has been conquered: catastrophic threats like famine and pestilence have been neutralized, and any of the remaining obstacles to survival are, for the first time in history, on the retreat. Whereas humanity used to be oppressed by the threat of the natural world, humanity has now turned the tables and the natural world has been beat into submission.So, what is the new agenda for humanity moving forward? Harari suggests three goals will occupy the attention of humanity in the twenty-first century: overcome death, discover true happiness, and become divine. Simple enough. But this is not a joke for Harari, and the breezy and dismissive way of describing such a hubris undertaking is, unfortunately, not hyperbole. Harari himself channels the essence of breeziness when describing the problem and solution of death: “In reality… humans don’t die because a figure in a black cloak taps them on the shoulder, or because God decreed it, or because morality is an essential part of some great cosmic plan. Humans always die due to some technical glitch… Nothing metaphysical about it” (pg. 22-23). He goes on to say, “And every technical problem has a technical solution. We don’t need to wait for the Second Coming in order to overcome death. A couple of geeks in a lab can do it. If traditionally death was the specialty of priests and theologians, now the engineers are taking over” (pg. 23). There you have it. The first box on the human agenda’s to-do-list is as good as checked—the “geeks in a lab coat” will see to it that the glitch of death is resolve.What of true happiness? Despite the fact that “our happiness bangs against some mysterious glass ceiling that does not allow it to grow despite all our unprecedented accomplishments” (pg. 35), Harari is still convinced that the solution to the problem is surely within the physical sciences. Unhappiness, like death, is nothing more than a material glitch, and so whatever will crack the code for happiness (like a-mortality) will inevitably be a material patch.This, the astute reader may say, is all well and good, but what of the third task on humanity’s agenda? Modest efforts like finding the scientific solution to death and happiness are one thing, but finding the scientific solution to becoming divine? Is a staunch materialist really allowed to admit to striving for divinity? Is that not an embarrassing exercise of having one’s cake while eating it too? Not according to Harari. His escape hatch is to define “divinity” with a bit of self-restraint. “If this sounds unscientific or downright eccentric, it is because people misunderstand the meaning of divinity. Divinity isn’t a vague metaphysical quality. And it isn’t the same as omnipotence. When speaking of upgrading humans into gods, think more in terms of Greek gods or Hindu devas rather than the omnipotent sky father” (pg. 47). Now that is more like it. A secular age will not abide any notion of the biblical God, but some good old-fashioned paganism will do just fine.Everything mentioned thus far occurs within the first seventy pages of his volume, but the rest of Homo Deus is essentially elaborating and building off of what chapter one explodes with. In chapter two, Harari considers what all of this break-neck-speed progress has meant for the rest of creation. The rest of the animal kingdom, says Harari, has been left coughing on the dust humanity has left it in. Harari writes this chapter with a tone of moral indignation that boggles the mind. Whereas he writes of humanity’s movement past itself with in a spirit of cool rationality, approving of genetic engineering and selective abortion with all the sentimentalism of an anarchist with a can of gasoline and a matchstick, somehow, he is able to introduce words like “tragic” in describing humanity’s treatment of lower creatures. Harari continues the same line of thinking from a different angle in the next chapter. Whereas chapter two affirms the undervalued assumptions of lower animals, chapter three argues for the overvalued assumptions of humanity. I.e., What makes humanity so special?In the next section of the book, chapters four through seven, Harari gives his take on how humanity has fared with its assessment of itself thus far. Chapter seven, “The Humanist Revolution,” is far and away the best, most clear-headed chapter in the book. According to Harari, the world’s most prominent religion is humanity’s worship of itself. “Whereas traditionally the great cosmic plan gave meaning to the life of humans, humanism reverses the roles and expects the experiences of humans to give meaning to the cosmos” (pg. 223). In this, Harari is undoubtedly right, and his assessment can hardly be refuted: “In ethics, the humanist motto is ‘if it feels good – do it’. In politics, humanism instructs us that ‘the voter knows best’. In aesthetics, humanism says that ‘beauty is in the eye of the beholder’” (pg. 231).From this kind of flat-footed common-sense analysis, however, Harari will occasionally take a hard turn into the absurd. For example, in his historical assessment of humanism’s three primary strands—liberalism, socialism, and evolutionary humanism—he correctly links the evils of Hitler’s regime to his evolutionary humanism. “Nazism was born,” says Harari, “from the pairing of evolutionary humanism with particular racial theories and ultra-nationalist emotions” (pg. 258). This is true. But rather than pointing to the ills of Nazism as a cautionary tale against deriving one’s ideology from evolutionary humanism, Harari writes, “Auschwitz should serve as a blood-red warning sign rather than as a black curtain that hides entire sections of the human horizon. Evolutionary humanism played an important part in the shaping of modern culture, and is likely to play an ever greater role in the shaping of the twenty-first century” (pg. 259). Which essentially amounts to his saying, “Let’s perhaps try this out again and see if we get a different result.”Harari has this reviewer’s sympathies for how grueling it must have been to write the last four chapters of his book. One can only imagine how difficult it must be for an individual to write a book published under one’s individual name, with the paychecks for it being deposited into one’s individual bank account, while one attempts to write about the illusion of individualism. “Science,” says Harari, “undermines not only the liberal belief in free will, but also the belief in individualism” (pg. 292). But Harari may himself not like the unhappy conclusion, and may very well simply be assuming the role of a good neighbor. This is certainly the impression the reader gets when he dryly explains the new religion of datism—which can only truly be described as paganistic monism from the future.In Homo Deus, Harari has constructed an impressively high edifice of toothpicks and marshmallows. One cannot help but admire it as an endearing craft-activity, but one cannot seriously consider putting any weight on it. From his basic premises, Harari’s logic is injured. For example, when Harari attempts to show how untenable it is to believe in metaphysical realities, like human souls or God, he writes “That’s why the theory of evolution cannot accept the idea of souls, at least if by ‘soul’ we mean something indivisible, immutable and potentially eternal. Such an entity cannot possibly result from a step-by-step evolution” (pg. 105). Which is to say, “We cannot accept the existence of metaphysical realities because as of yet, no physical test have been able to verify their existence.” True. As an unabashed metaphysician, I can say with confidence, it never will.Another example of this kind of tomfoolery is the fact that Harari labors for an entire chapter to prove that there is no such thing as an individual after he has already conceded that his worldview cannot explain consciousness: “The best scientists too are a long way from deciphering the enigma of mind and consciousness. One of the wonderful things about science is that scientists don’t know something, they can try out all kinds of theories and conjunctures, but in the end they can just admit their ignorance” (pg. 111). I am no scientist, but methinks one would have to be able to define a consciousness before definitively ruling it out as a possible existing entity. There is much more than can be said about this book, and we have not even mentioned the overwhelming chronological snobbery. But for now, speaking as a Christian theologian, this review may conclude with a simple summary: with enemies like Yuval Noah Harari, Christianity needs no friends.

  The reader of Homo Deus suspects that the author was paid by the word. He bangs on for pages on topics that could be wrapped up in a paragraph.The author leans heavily on concepts such as 'consciousness' and ‘meaning’ (as in “give meaning to the universe”) as if they were universally and uniformly understood.The author repeatedly asserts that science has ‘proven’ something. Real scientists rarely claim to prove anything. They say things like “Either the Higgs boson exists or we have observed an unlikely event.” (But we must give the author a break – he’s a historian.)One good quality of the book is that it, like Sapiens, makes outrageous claims that give the reader pause. Like “tomatoes are algorithms.” (No kidding.) Another good quality is that it points to the entirely plausible future when humans are to artificial intelligences as animals are to humans today. That's an image that's definitely worth a pause.

  I liked Sapiens, I think it was a very good book that was well researched and written.However, with Homo Deus the author steps out of his area of expertise and you can really see that in almost every chapter. It is also quite repetitive and too long in my view (contains some materials that are Sapiens related), and interest decays as you progress.In general, the book lacks calibre and intellectual solvency. It is highly biased and opinionated, a set of views and opinions with little fundamental support behind.At least, the book provides views on important current topics, and challenges your mind to dissent, but all in all, not recommended.

I learned nothing new or notable beyond Sapiens. I also object to the author's use of term Humanism as the philosophy of believing that humans are dominant over all other species. That's not what Humanism at all.

  This is the most challenging book I’ve read since – well perhaps ever, not because the author’s style is in any way difficult but because it challenged my basic beliefs of about everything from the first page.The first two thirds of the book bring us up to date from the time of the primordial ooze to the present; then the author takes all of the knowledge we have acquired in all the sciences and arts and basically debunks much of it, and quite effectively.Spoiler alert: this book is not for the seriously religious among us. He makes no bones about it: God is dead and has been for most moderns for several centuries. He assumes his readers are liberal humanists and wastes little time defending his position; that given, he allows us to keep our religion as the useful fount of morality since we’re not very good creatures without it. But make no mistake there’s no real God in this religion.Modern liberal humanism allowed us – all of us moderns – to throw off religion although it gave thousands of years of satisfaction to our forbears by promising them meaningful survival after death if not in this life. Humanism gave us liberty and freedom and provided meaning for us while we strode the planet through love, art, scientific achievement, business acumen, governance or anything else that we might favor. But that left us relatively empty and that’s when we brought back the trappings of religion to provide us with a little comfort.After establishing us as the dominant species and killing off all that had made life unbearable for our ancestors, he states that we really have no free will which is the basis of liberal humanism. Between biology and computer science and neurobiology, science has concluded our minds are simply mathematical algorithms. These algorithms have been honed by eons of evolution to provide us with the best possible outcomes from flight or fight and for passing along our best genetic outcomes.But, but along come supercomputing algorithms which even now in the hands of Google, Microsoft, Facebook and others are beginning to know us better than we can possibly know ourselves. These algorithms make human decision making obsolete since we just can’t know ourselves as well as the algorithms and thus cannot compete with them in knowing ourselves and for making our best personal decisions.The author discusses many of the long held positions of members of this group and more often than not blows holes in each of our favorite positions. Walt’s fear of cyber warfare (no debunking here); Walt and Frank’s faith in job retraining; my concern AI will displace almost all workers; the fear – held by none of us that – computers will do away with humans; and many others are trotted out and handled with great skill…if not entirely believably.While I’d give it less than five stars on Amazon’s scale, it held my attention for the days it took me to read it. The first two thirds are absolutely devastating to my long held views on many subjects particularly free will. As a liberal humanist from my youth, free will has always been front and center in my thinking. Harari makes a strong case against this and while I reject the point, I can martial few answers to reject it.The final third contains Harari’s views on the most likely futures for the world and its human inhabitants. While I’ve argued that computers and artificial intelligence will probably wipe out more jobs than it creates, he takes it – in the very out years – that these forces may wind up with no use for us and could let us die or even exterminate us.  That was far too dystopian for me and I rejected most of what he says the further he gets from our time.The guy has a very fluid style and I recommend the read highly.Beyond the review of content, the book while ONLY about 450 pages, including notes and index, it is printed on high quality heavy paper and it actually hurt my hands to read for long periods.

  ""Homo Deus"" should actually be subtitled ""Why I have nothing but contempt for Religion, Humanism, and Science"".  The first 306 pages have nothing to do with ""A Brief History of Tomorrow"".  The author is using this follow-up to his best-seller ""Sapiens"" (which I loved) as an editorial outlet to rant against all the things he thinks are wrong.  Big on his list is our treatment of animals which includes inhumane living conditions ending with their death to be eaten by people.  He basically says ""eating meat is bad"" one hundred different ways.  I get it, he thinks animals have rights and should not be eaten.The author knows a bit about human sociology, anthropology, and maybe even human nature, but this book is a perfectly good waste of high-quality paper the first 306 pages.  Pages 307 to 397 are okay because he actually sticks to the topic of the book (a brief history of tomorrow).  So the book should have been a 90-page book at the most.  A huge waste of time, and yes, I read every page.

  Since its earliest existence, the human race has devoted virtually all of its resources and attention to address three vital issues; famine, disease and war.  It is the author’s premise that entering the 21st century, these previously overriding concerns have been largely conquered, leaving the question, “What now”?Well, according to the author, “what now” is a quest for immortality, and the concept may not be as far-fetched as many people think, leading to a new form of human, hence the title of the book, Homo Deus.I purchased this book, because I thought it might contain a lot of predictions on the future of the human race, based upon recent advances in biotechnology and medical sciences.  Instead, it largely consisted of long screeds on the development of humanistic philosophies, with only very broad, non-specific statements on what the future may hold.  In other words, a lot of philosophical discussion of the past and current state of the human race, and very little on the future.Finally, this is the densest book I have ever read.  No, not necessarily the subject matter, though if you are not into philosophy, the subject matter may (will) bore you to tears.  I’m talking about physical density.  I don’t know what kind of paper stock the publisher used, but this book weighed about 10 pounds. If Dickens had used similar stock, David Copperfield would have required a forklift to move.

  First I got jealous that Harari is able to write a huge bestseller while only connecting some obvious historical and scientific trends in humanity , but then I calmed myself that folks like Deepak Chopra have been deemed prophets, writing bestsellers.But the reason for my review is that his thick book actually presents too many simplistic explanations, makes too many straw-man connections to draw too many conclusions that are unecessarily hopeful, or more often dystopian.best to show this by examples : Harari spends 1/3rd of the book on ancient history basically saying that it is all explained by noting that humans are animals, but only with their algorithms designed to get groups of humans to do things - Pharoah to build Canals and pyramids on the Nile, or China building the Three Gorges Dam, for two instances. Hasnt Harari heard of flocks of birds or hives of bees ? - humans are not the only ones to organise to groups with common purpose, although we are clearly the most successful at it.On to the next straw man argument that I found underwhelming, if not outright false. Harari claims that the modern technological revolution, of humans connected to devices providing information has created vast 'useless classes'and then claims, tantalizingly, that the 21st century has rendered humanity so that all have power, but none have meaning - 'power has replaced meaning'. After all a rambling, it seems because he thinks our 'narrating selfs' (Deepak Chopra wrote junk) will dominate our 'experiencing selfs' ( this Harari has written junk)Now, I agree that nobody has Power much anymore - not just because Trump , or Weinstein, or Cosby is widely jeered, but with the wide reach of information, everybody has the opportunity to avoid becoming subject to the power of another.But has it replaced 'meaning'? - What exactly was the 'meaning of life' for 7 billion humans before 2007 when that charlatan Steve Jobs invented the iphone ?This sounds vaguely like Harari rehashing 'God is Dead, we have killed him' declaration of Nietzsche 150 years before.And so Harari explains that the robots, drones etc will deny the 'liberal' idea of 'free will' by hacking our brains to make us believe what they want. in short, Facebook can steal elections in the future too. This AI will take over the world common bogeyman of Artificially Intelligent robots computers taking over the world, but again does not explain how these computers are going to provide the 'meaning', the myths, the 'narrating self' that sustains humanity and how will they merge all 7 billion narratives ?! - far from Homo Deus, I thought this was Homo BS.all that said, the book has plenty of anecdotes, historical connections and wry humor that keeps the reader entertained for the most part - that is why I give it two stars, not one:-)

  This book, along with Sapiens, offers a broad and intelligent look at our past and possibilities for our future.  Harari is a prophet for the 21st century, not in the sense of making specific predictions but in terms of laying out the forces that will determine those possible futures.  The most powerful of these forces is the increase in data, the capacity for artificial intelligence to analyze that data, and advances in bioengineering.  As the television commercial puts it, ""We are putting sensors into everything and everything into the cloud"".  While AI works on all of that data it will also improve itself, creating ever more powerful algorithms.  While we are in the process of creating the Internet of All Things, Harari asks if this new creation will simply swallow our species whole.  Or, will our increased capacity for bioengineering create super sapiens who will look on the masses as we now look on animals?  In the intermediate term it is almost certain that big data and AI will transform our economy and make it unnecessary for many people to work.  What will happen to them?  What will their lives be like?  The probability that our societies will be dramatically transformed by these emerging technologies makes it increasingly important that we decide what kind of a society we want for future generations.Harari's work is very similar to that of Stephen Pinker, but goes further by anticipating the end of humanism and the rise of dataism.  At this point Harari offers disturbing speculations, but his vision is fully grounded in the rapid growth of data, AI, and bioengineering.  Will these new technologies eliminate humanism's doctrine that sapiens are the measure of all things?  If so, could that be a good thing?  And if the individual human experience is no longer the center of the universe, what will be?  Dataism?  An elite group of ubermenschen?  Something else?  Just as the energy from fossil fuels began as a gift to humanity and now threatens our survival as a species, the combination of big data, AI, and bioengineering will not only change the nature of human culture, but possibly the very nature of sapiens.

  Such a huge disappointment. I liked Sapiens and the title of this new book was intriguing. But this was such a waste of time. It is a rambling mess of flight of ideas, incoherent hodgepodge of history, religion, science, philosophy and anthropology tidbits without a coherent message.Harari makes a useless mockery and ridicule of religion in a childish way. Especially his repeated references toward biblical religions are superficial and have no connection whatsoever to the subject of this book.His comparisons between humans and animals are also ridiculously superficial.He hardly discusses the future of humanity with any substance.Overall this is a waste of time.

  A lot of leaps in logic to arrive at a predetermined destination, but you'll have that. Overall, thought provoking.The reliance on economic reality preempts the possibilities of social reality. Harari recognizes this and covers it a bit as indeterminable social variables through discussion of things like gaps in neuroscience, unknown mental states, and the fusion of biology and technology. Because yes, we’re just beginning to realize how much we don’t know we don’t know. However, the author strongly favors the economic reality as always and necessarily “dominant” to the social reality. But there’s reality and then there's the narrative of the reality, touched upon very briefly in discussion of left/right brain communication. Narrative matters. In fact, it’s crucial to the data. We are nothing if not the story we tell ourselves (I mean, isn’t this the nucleus around which the very concept of something like Homo Deus revolves?), that's true on both a social and economic scale. If social narratives can become a means of production, which is reduced to data (itself a choice of quantitative), what happens when the data itself, as in the case of humanity, is both sentient/conscious and capable of becoming a market force itself? Of course, this requires coordination, which requires a cooperation narrative. Thus far, we’ve collectively “agreed” to pursue social narratives of dominance over cooperation. Me first, f you. Might equals right, etc. (Thanks, history.) No one can argue he gets that wrong. However, it’s important to note that if a social narrative emerges that pivots on cooperation and does actually pursue coordination of a consciously-driven narrative instead of increasingly relying on dataism, it undermines a lot of his deductions. (Which he graciously welcomes. I stan.)I would argue that the only way we might actually become Homo Deus is by surrendering the entire concept of power (i.e. domination narrative) itself (or at least, placing it where it belongs as no more than a potentially enjoyable fiction) or even by recognizing it has been the only narrative we’ve ever chosen to believe in. The only god ever worshipped. If all you have is a hammer (hierarchy) everything looks like a nail (humanity self-inflicting hierarchy upon itself) It is indeed, as advertised, a future of the past. If we want a different outcome, we need to put different variables into the algorithm/narrative. Yes, it’s realistic to ask “where has all the power gone?”, but it’s equally important, I think, to ask “when and how will we let go of power as an antiquated social narrative that no longer serves a purpose?”. We need an imaginative algorithm.I think he could stand to read/watch more scifi. We’re already out here creating an endless amount of narratives and possibilities to pursue, if we’re collectively brave enough to step outside “reality”. As he says, knowledge that doesn’t change behavior is useless. It’s true that reaching out isn’t the same as obtaining, but it’s also true that obtaining is impossible without reaching out. Science was born of curiosity and imagination, to simply conclude that it will go on autonomically without either in the future is to me, well, unimaginative. How we decide to handle our evolution will be based on whatever conscious narrative we chose to filter it through, and in that regard I found the discussion somewhat lacking.

  The opening chapters of this book promise a descriptive argument that seeks to really dissect humanism and analyze what possibilities lie for us in the future. Instead you find a collection of rants and one-sided arguments that are lazily brought back to relate to a central argument. The lenses through which the author chooses to tell history definitely make for a good narrative but if your familiar with any of the works/studies he references you can clearly see what extreme liberties have been taken. This by no means is a bad book but the topic itself is better presented by a scientist or engineer who is more familiar with the referenced technology/science purported on. As it stands this book gives no greater insight into the future of mankind than what the typical tech magazine hypes. There are a lot of good books out there and I would recommend spending your money/time on a different one than this.

  Homo Deus by Yuval Noah Harari, is in many ways a follow on to his previous book, Sapiens, published in 2014.Sapiens is essentially a history of the human race. A key theme in the book was the ascent of Homo Sapiens,about 70,000 years ago, to a unique position of dominance of our planet. Harari’s thesis is that the fundamental ability responsible for this dominance is the unique human ability to fabricate artificial entities such as money, religions, nations and corporations which permit coordination of individuals on a vastly larger scale than is possible for other animals, including earlier human species such as Neanderthals. Sapiens also contains some extrapolation of current trends and begins to ask the question: where do we go from here?Homo Deus recapitulates some of the history in Sapiens, but focuses squarely on the future. One focus is the primary religions, or belief systems, which guide progress.  Classical religions, which dominated for thousands of years, relied on supreme beings and their earthly manifestations (church, synagogue, mosque, etc.) as the fundamental arbiters of  human behavior. In the last couple of hundred years, classical religions have given way to humanism, which sanctifies human life and human feelings above all else. Liberal humanism is the classical form associated with democracies and free markets, but variants such as social humanism (communism) and evolutionary humanism (naziism) have evolved.Harari sees the priorities of humanism (human life and feelings) guiding genetic engineering toward increased longevity and human capabilities. However, these would be available to an elite, which may no longer have an incentive to support democratic institutions for a vast, less capable underclass. Once a majority of the population are no longer either militarily or economically important, how long will they be extended the courtesy of equal rights? Thereby, humanism sews the seeds of its own destruction.Harari also introduces the concept of dataism, a new religion or belief system in which the acquisition, distribution and processing of data, both by biological organisms and computers transcends the interests of the individual. This is not as remote as it sounds, given the role in our lives and decisions currently played by Google, Facebook and Amazon. This leads us into a world where human beings are “chips”, each making small contributions to the Internet of All Things.Harari has a gift of seeing the big picture, and extrapolates possible futures with compelling logic. These futures have a decidedly dark side, for those of us who embrace liberal humanism. All the more reason to understand where we may be headed. Highly recommended.

  Where Sapiens basically described what made any historical period, except maybe hunter-gathering, not worth living in for most people, this volume lays out the various future options for dysfunction and self-obliteration in equally inspiring terms.  Everything is presented as if the author is rushing to point out things no-one else has seen, which means that we get straw-man and high contrast either-or type scenarios. In each case one senses a more complicated underlying issue, if surely a relevant one. It is all very well written.  YNH seems to speak from within each scenario, so readers have questions as to where he is coming from and whom he is addressing.  Religious practitioners won’t touch this, and the humanists won’t recognize themselves in his caricature. Maybe the average reader won’t think they are the described hacked to the core voter-consumer scattered non-selves, or algorithms bundled together, deterministically unfolding. If the author believes we can suspend those dynamics to attend to this book, he is not making it clear how. Of course determinists seem to consider themselves excempt.  YNH’s Buddhist leanings have helped me understand his thinking process. Disclosure: I am influenced by Buddhist practice, but find certain dogma unconvincing.  Humanistic-liberal (they seem thrown together) “ideology"" or ""religion” is such a bugaboo because it values the individual, and in Buddhism the individual ‘self’ is an illusion and as such the root of all evil.  The bias also shows itself when social institutions and instruments are referred to as “imaginations”, ""fictions"" That dog whistle frequency harmonizes with ‘delusions’, which are strong drivers in unenlightened human affairs.  Unfortunately the buddhist argument is itself somewhat convoluted. It turns out that the real problem is with, well, life itself. All life-forms, human, animal, god-like, fail at true existence, which is having a permanent essence. This is unfortunate and ironic in a universe not composed of such entities.  But since an essence we must have, humans somehow manage to “feel” as if they have one at the core of their being. This delusion causes a toxic dynamic of not seeing things as they are (basically impermanent, interconnected and missing essences) and motivates all kinds of selfish behavior. The ultimate goal, which may take innumerable lifetimes, is to get off the wheel of death and rebirth altogether.  This is the negative coin-side of an essence based ideology. Something is missing that really should have been there. Without that, what is there to care about or hold on to? Things arise and fall away. Of course, Buddhism is known for compassion with suffering, and also promotes the idea of an immanent true nature spontaneously seeing and doing right, but here only the critical aspect is apparent.  Science supports some buddhist findings but explores how things actually interconnect without the notion of something missing. YNH is really on the attack when it comes to humanism’s valuation of humans as individuals.  He makes it the culprit of a go for broke pursuit of eternal life, but all you need for that is a few resourced individuals, comfortable enough not to find the idea crazy. And all they need in front of them are the problems the Buddha identified: old age, sickness and death. Humanists ‘ideology’ is not required. Death with dignity is a good humanist alternative. Humanists had a hand in launching the scientific method, which proceeds by distrusting individual observations and conclusions. This was instrumental in placing humans in a vast universe, and launched the investigations into our place and nature that YNH so frequently draws upon. The interest in other, expanded mind states grew out of liberal societies not locked onto one faith system.  I don’t see YNH making up his mind whether our delusional experience of self is based on a presumed essence or identification with the varied narrations that occur in consciousness. Neither seem compelling as primary sources.  In any case, the notion that essence based identity is necessary for humanists is a canard. That would depend on their religious-scientific stance. The experience of identity or self, is a matter for exploration, but we can’t talk ourselves out of the necessity of the notion. We do represent ourselves as persisting - and changing - over time.  To conceive of continuity you need at minimum a functioning organism, stable and sophisticated enough to reference itself intelligently and make coherent distinctions in an environment that itself is stable enough to make these useful. The ‘inner self’ intuition seems due to the fact that we realize our consciousness does not pull itself out of its own hat. We only have theories of how it arises and is structured, it now seems to involve the whole brain and its subsystems, which accounts for the fact that we have rich inner lives in stead of a one note samba.  YNH also argues that the humanist endeavor is lost if we can’t prove free will, however even deterministic humanists perceive value. Unfortunately, the free will argument is stuck in essence thinking if it requires us to pull action from an immaculate realm via immaculate conception. I would more modestly argue the advantages of conditioned will that is alive to the being I actually am and the world I actually live in. Nobody knows how consciousness and organic operations relate. It is safe to say that they co-evolved, are hard to pry apart, and that the organism places a very costly priority on the quality, coherence and explanatory value of conscious content. In actual practice, the subtle and responsive intelligence of humans can be quite impressive, even when busy mapping out how much it sucks.  When larger social structures and instruments are bundled together as imaginations or ideology-religions, important distinctions disappear. They are all seen as oppressive false views and if there are any positive effects, for example of capitalism as it is erratically practiced, they are acknowledged, but as if they were unintended consequences.  Of course locked down ideological liberalism exists, but some high functioning nations utilize both capitalism and large scale social instruments in managing areas of need not covered. Such societies insist on the input of their citizens not because they are self-enlightened, but because nobody is. What the individual is the authority of, may only be how it feels to be that individual, but this is enough reason to give them some little say in matters that affect them. Useful education is seen as crucial, as is having structures that give citizens means for participation.  Seeing nations and social structures as ‘imaginations’, anchors for false beliefs and attachments, is the luxury complaint of someone who doesn’t have to come up with large scale solutions to large scale problems. You need frames for regulating complex activity, and without such frames certain things deemed useful just won’t happen. The way fictions and actual false beliefs impact is different.  YNH’s quotable version of a new ruling ideology-religion starts its life as a caricature. Most ideologies promote large scale structural change as accomplishing some human good, that's their job - and then the hacking and unintended consequences set in. Data-ism is already conceived as rendering humans irrelevant, algorithms in an ocean of algorithms, and the free flow of information, the core purpose, is already described as the one-directional of flow from humans to larger entities of suppression or manipulation. At least everyone would know how to make biological weapons.  But if we agree that big data is a problem, where is the solution going to come from if you propose that everything really just is algorithms and data? Data-ism has the look of a reductionism and these always have the same effect: the universe appears as an abstraction if seen through an abstraction. It goes well with the Buddhist view of fundamental insubstantiality though.  Some humans and nations already see the problem and are trying to manage the flow of data, and increase transparency. In the midst of a pandemic, the advantages of sharing data intelligently are indisputable.  Humanists insist that we care about humans. Why?  Who cares, is the question to ask. My humanist position is that the primary units worth caring about are those that can care - including caring if others care. This is as close to self evident as we are going to get. This expands naturally into wondering about the inner lives of other organisms or other states of mind. If the whales have exquisite artistic communications it is of ‘value’ to them, and could be indirectly to us if we explore further, but true communication comes from within similar minds. This is why some algorithms are more equal than others.  To take the example of music, a musical composition - or 'algorithm' - only works as anything at all in the human mind. The anger directed at the competent listener-analyst who designed composing computer programs is not that they diminished great composers, because without them compelling models would not exist, but because humans do not like to be hacked and fooled. It is a basic biological ‘algorithm’, if you will, that has positive and negative expressions, but might be useful here. The point and value of music is human communication and contact, and it does not get better the more complex it gets, but the better it serves as a means of communication of the varieties of human experience.  Should we care if objectively speaking, any attribution of value may be a misattribution, adding something that the object does not have 'in itself'? No, as it turns out, in a seemingly uncaring universe the best truths are relative.  YNH ridicules the mental gymnastics of some humanists trying to argue for the value of humans in view of all evidence of our conditioned and fallible nature, but I would like to see the gymnastics behind writing these books if such value is argued away.  As it turns out the professor has all along just wanted to present us with some possible scenarios so he can give us a homework assignment at the end to help us, what? make up our own minds?  Make the world better after all by being our own agents of change?? What a humanistic idea!  My assignment to the professor is to articulate what is there to care about in the first place.

  this was recommended to me by someone who's taste in books i trust.  it was a rare miss.  this is absolutely awful.it's trite, obvious, full of stunning logical fallacies and over generalizations, and demonstrates a deeply slanted and indoctrinated view of history that skews so far to the authoritarian and statist as to render actual events unrecognizable.the first portion alone where harari slews recklessly into bentham without seeming to understand even the basic contradictions or difficulties in such a thing should be enough to convince a discerning reader with a modicum of sense to abandon this as a read.  it was the only book i had with me, so i soldiered on.  i wish i hadn't.  it just gets worse and never says anything that has not been said better in 12 other places.in short, the interesting parts are obvious and derivative and the rest is a dog's breakfast of illogic, nested assumptive fallacies, and outlandish claims and over-generalization stemming from a deeply dogmatic world view.i honestly cannot believe people liked this book.  perhaps this is less glaring and disappointing if one shares the author's prejudices and predilections (that are deeply authoritarian and technocratic without understanding any of the perils of such doctrines) and is willing to forgive aggregation fallacies and assumptions about what can be measured and whether that allows a right to impose such things.if this is where humanity is going, we're cooked.harari seems determined to double down on the same top down heavy handed technocratic despotism that has done so much to hold back progress in the human condition over the last decade and never seems to consider that correlation does not demonstrate causality and that perhaps the very institutions he lauds have been acting as a brake and not the gas.it's a shallow, limited, dogmatic think piece with very little actual insight and no new ideas .

  Sapiens is one of my top 3 favourite books of all time, so I had such a tremendous expectation for this sequel. In retrospect, it is still a brilliant book with vast range of topics filled with plenty of data and insights that are signature of Harari. Some parts are even world class.However, almost the majority of the contents are stretched a little too long, and give the feel like they are only the extended notes that didn’t get the cut in Sapiens. Moreover, it is not really a direct book about the future, in which I expected to be like the brilliant last chapter in Sapiens. But instead it dwells quite some time in history, thus the overlapping feel with his 1st book.And when we finally arrived at the predictions of the future? Nothing is really new, although to be fair I have read, watched, and listened to a lot of interviews with Harari talking about this book.All in all, when reading this book, I can’t help but feeling like when I’m watching the 8th season of Game of Thrones. Sure, it’s brilliant on its own. But when we compare it with the early 7 seasons it becomes obvious that it’s a rather disappointing follow up from the build up.Already bought his 3rd book though. And I remain a massive fan.

  This is a very uneven book, alternating from brilliant passages to speculation that can be pretty off the wall.  Harari has an engaging style and some very interesting broad interpretations of historical trends, but I found his views on future biology and technology to be crude at best and completely unfounded at worst; he throws in a lot of philosophy and assumptions that I found questionable.The historical sections are quite fun.  We have, he says, entered the Anthropocene Age, in which man dominates and shapes the environment of the entire planet.  Instead of viewing himself as part of the landscape and co-equal with the animals, as hunter gatherers did, neolithic farmers began to believe that they were in control of their destinies so long as the gods were properly propitiated, in a kind of contract.  Eventually, a monotheistic God emerged, whose laws were preserved in sacred texts that could provide all answers; with the rapid urbanization that accompanied this, the Gods also functioned as an instrument of elite control.  A major new step was taken when the humanists came to the fore during the Renaissance, whereby men were to look within themselves as well as observe the natural world rather than to a God for the ultimate answers.  Finally, classical liberalism took hold during the Enlightenment and the democratic revolutions of the late 18C to 19C, valuing the individual's voice; the experience of individuals was held up as unique and worthwhile, bound as it was to industrialization.So far, so good.  One can quibble with his interpretations of history, but at least they are comprehensible, backed by evidence and, to a degree, academic consensus.  However, Harari then indulges in some extraordinary claims.  With biotechnology and AI, he argues, mankind may now strive for immortality, perpetual happiness, and even God-like power.The arguments he makes to prove this have a veneer of scientific proof.  For starters, all living things are essentially ""algorithms"", i.e. beings who, within the limits of their genetic endowments, engage in certain processes to cope with the environment and hopefully thrive (i.e. pass on their genes).  Up to now, the being at the apex of this has been man, whose technologies have enabled us to dominate all other life, indeed all nature.  Furthermore, AI is now producing algorithms that are ""superior"" to man and rapidly moving beyond our capabilities - we are losing control as computers will surpass us in all occupations, etc., perhaps even producing overarching truths humans will never comprehend.  Finally, as a result, the liberal order will fall - man will either go extinct or lose his individual value beyond these superior algorithms, surrendering not just his free will (an illusion in Harari's view) but all control over the course of life.  Voting, caring, even individual experience will lose its relevance as machines take over.No one can say if these things will come to pass, but I am not impressed by the logic underlying it all.  First, who will decide what is ""better""?  Harari seems to define that as more efficient or a clearer view of the truth, but I could only see that in a world of black and white.  If machines do it, who is to say whether it IS better?  For example, Harari argues at length that medical doctors will become obsolete:  computers will keep tabs on all relevant factors, diagnosing what pills or treatments to mete out better and faster than a human ever could.  What this neglects to consider, in my opinion, is that healing requires a human touch, just as children require intimate contact to grow.Second, men (and women, of course) will have a say in who defines ""superior"", which they can build into our systems.  I thought about Asimov's 3 laws of robotics here.  Third, Harari seems to be arguing for a reductionist and mechanistic view of the human mind, i.e. it is not more than the sum of its algorithms.  As such, he believes, individualism and free will are illusions springing from an ignorance that is being overtaken by AI.  Fourth, he argues that a new kind of ""enhanced elite"" will emerge, the only people who will matter, who are differentiated from the masses by biotech-enhanced abilities (immortal, smarter, stronger).  It would be a kind of speciation.  Again, I am dubious that such a thing can be done.  For example, he blithely throws around terms like nanotechnology as a way to repair cells, but anyone who knows any biological science is aware of how little we know of how cells operate, let alone that we can manage and repair them in any detail beyond the crudest functions.  One geneticist I know says we are 20 generations away from a grand synthesis of molecular biology.It is popular to say that Silicon Valley is enthusiastic about his take.  If they are, then I think they are credulous naifs.  This book reminds me of the junk that the original Wired magazine used to publish, e.g. Out of Control by Kevin Kelley.  It's booster science fiction, wild speculations that are unprovable.  Harari know far less than he projects, in my humble opinion.I would recommend this book as a stimulating read.  But it needs to be read with skepticism.

  I have seen some fantastic reviews detailing the contents about this book.  So I am going to focus more on the ""book"" aspect of this non-fiction book.I have read Sapiens.  I have rated 5/5.  It was a very concise and well written book about history.  In Homo Deus,  I have struggled to read as effortlessly as the first book.  At times Harari goes into lengthy debates and need-to-prove points that he makes the reading less than enjoyable.  His discussion about brain vs. mind vs. consciousnesses was rather lengthy and it costed me a whole month before I was able to get back to the book.Also, I felt in the last third of the book lack of coherence in his arguments.  In such a book I would expect either a) give your headline view and go on proving why your view holds or b) lay the foundation and summarize to a headline.  At times the discussions, examples were feeling almost as a proof of ""I know what I am talking about"".But despite these criticism, this book is a must read to start thinking about the future on the wake of AI revolution.

  While his former book ""A Brief History of Human Kind"" is a true masterpiece. This book is too speculative. Yuval is still a very knowledgeable person, and you can still learn a lot. Also just like in his former book, it is not hard to tell what is an opinion and what is knowledge. Just like the former book he also makes a lot of provocative opinions. The main problem with this book, is that while in ""a brief history of humankind""  each opinion is not heavilly based on the former ones. In this book he builds up his opinions a speculation upon a speculation, and while he is a very wise person, it suffices that you'd disagree with one of the assumptions for losing much of the engagement with this book.When you build such a structure of speculations upon speculations, even if all of them are reasonable by themselves, it suffice that one of the to be incorrect for the whole structure to collapse. The success of science was mainly because we were careful enough not to build  such speculation structures. Still a very interesting book by a very interesting person.

  Whereas Sapiens was a book full of ""aha"" moments, in which a series of facts and analysis become an almost-obvious insight, Home Deus is less psychologically rewarding. This is because, instead of analyzing history and wrapping it up strategically, Harari focuses Homo Deus in speculating a bit about the future. And, in order to do this, he tries to dig into who humankind's nature.He considers the huge advances in nutrition, health, longevity, and peace (well-documented in Steven Pinker's Enlightenment Now), and combines them with his view about the main drivers for our behavior, to come out with some theories about our potential future.Home Deus is not an easy read sometimes because, as Harari goes deep into human nature, he ends up exploring controversial topics such as the soul's existence, the reasons behind happiness, and the degree to which we are free.So, even though (for me) Homo Deus has a less enjoyable angle, which sometimes feels almost like depressing, I still found it a powerful book with significant food for thought, written in the same smart didactical way that Sapiens was.

  After Sapiens this was a great disappointment. Some very good insights that were spoiled by so much lazy thinking hidden within a great writing style; far too many assertions, misleading comparisons, and gross over-simplifications.The discussion of humanist education conflates elite education with the reality of mass education, the latter being more about socialization and rote learning than any attempt at helping individuals to truly think for themselves. The division of humanism into liberalism, socialism/communism, and evolutionary humanism shoehorns so many variations into three highly simplified and misleading divisions. “Socialists blame liberals for focusing our attention on our feelings” he says. I really don’t think that is that high on most socialist agendas, more the gross inequalities of wealth and power within society hidden under liberalist myths. The author keeps putting words into other people’s mouths, including even Marx, without any real supporting evidence. It is a clever device but not real scholarship, and highly deceptive. At the same time there is no mention of the extensive use of slavery, colonialist exploitation and outright genocide during the period that humanism developed.He correctly identifies such things as “the market” as being cultural inter-subjective creations rather than real things, but then treats these creations as independent entities with minds of their own. Statements such as “Like capitalism, Dataism too began as a neutral scientific theory” show a phenomenal level of naiveté and historical blindness. Capitalism was, and still is, an ideology (or perhaps a religion, using his definition of religion). The likes of Adam Smith and David Ricardo were highly politicized individuals, pushing a certain vision of the future – not a neutral scientific theory. It took hundreds of years of very conscious actions to make this ideology into a cultural reality – the enforced separation of the masses from the common lands, the creation of unencumbered property, the joint stock company, private banking etc.He also conflates the theoretical pure market with the reality of our highly oligopolistic “free” market that really exists. Then creates a straw man of the centralized government bureaucracy to compare to the decentralized market. There are many cases of decentralized government (e.g. the government funded research that lead to the internet and much of the science that he discusses) and centralized markets (e.g. Walmart directing its suppliers, Google directing our web searches).  China seems to be doing fine with a highly disciplinary bureaucracy overseeing a highly decentralized state limits upon such things as private property. Their leadership also seems to have a lot more vision than he credits them with. Government single-payer healthcare (in many cases highly distributed, as in Germany) also outperforms the “free-market” US version (with monopolistic centralized insurance companies and HMOs) by a healthy margin.Technology is also treated as some external entity, rather than the cultural creation that it is. Governments can, and should, control the ways in which technology develops. All of the basic research tends to come from government-funded research rather than funded by “the market”. I very much share some of his concerns about the misuse of technology, but the issue is many times more complex and open to real debate and political action than he proposes. The problem is as much the takeover of government by big business than the uncontrollability of technology. For example, people in the US may be awash in drug-induced states but that is much less the case in countries with legislatures less under the thumb of the pharmaceutical industry.

  Wow! A stimulating read.Readers shouldn't look to this book as a prognostication of what's next. Instead, as Harari tries to make clear, it's a litany of possibilities for the future of humanity. Many of these futures are possible, none is guaranteed.Harari is a historian who liberally dabbles in many areas of expertise, including some where he's less knowledgeable such as artificial intelligence and gene therapy. He doesn't hesitate to make sweeping conclusions. Yet that is also his strength: his ability to synthesize so much from so many fields, even if he likely doesn't get it all right or is shallower in some of the futuristic sciences. It is undeniable that our world, our economy, science, and technology are all changing very, very fast with implications we can only begin to grasp.I loved it because it got me thinking in new ways about who we are as a species and where we might be going. I have yet to read Sapiens, but look forward to it.

  First off I need to say that this is not light reading, there is a lot of food for thought in here. This book made me very optimistic at times, other times sort of worried. Harari covers a lot of ground in this. As he said several times this is just a book of ""ideas"" of possible out comes of the future with the way the tech, politics and world views are going and the branches they could take. This book makes a lot of sense and seem totally logical in many many ways. He carefully explains his points and how he comes to those conclusions and ideas, it's hard to argue with logic like that. Some of his thoughts of the future of how some technology would be used seemed reminiscent of an Orwellian or Huxley dystopia and those were the ones that worried me, but again seemed plausible, which was why they worried me. Over all I don't take away from this book a sense of fear of ""oh no what is man doing"", but more of sense of hope and wonder and a little bit of amazement that we as a species has made it this far and that we have brought ourselves to this point and may be at the next leaping point in our species evolution. If in a few centuries my great great great grandchildren look back with their genetically enhanced eyes, and think with there tech enhanced minds how backwards and primitive we were today in our thinking and world views I will be ok with that. Because even if they look back and see an inferior, simpler form of human it is still us who's shoulders they stand upon that got them to that vantage point just as we stand upon the shoulders of our Neolithic ancestors who we look back at who got us to where we stand today.

  First I loved the book. I heard a ton of new facts. Assuming they are all true, I gave the book five stars. But then some time passed and I was thinking. And the more I was thinking, the more I saw how wrong the author was on every topic on which I know a little. And now I am also doubting the facts that I know little about.It is hard to summarize how much wrong information and incorrect statements can be found in this book. But let me say just a few things on his main points, the disappearance of war, famine and plague, and of the emergence of Dataism.On war. Where can I start? War is not gone from this planet. On the contrary. Technology has only transformed it from a low grade persistent conflict to a rarer event, but with the potential to wipe out whole populations. I am writing this on 8/12/2017 while there are threats expressed between the North Korean and US leadership about the onset of nuclear war. Do I need to say more?We were during the Cold War actually quite lucky, because we came several times very close to the start of a nuclear war between the Superpowers.What is shocking, actually, when one finds out more about this author is this: he lives in Israel. Has he not served in the IDF? To claim that war is a thing of the past while living in a country that would cease to exist without its military might and that was almost overrun in a war a few decades ago is a sign of how deeply this author has buried his head in the proverbial sand.War gone? No, more like: war has became total, and we can now destroy the planet and all life on it several times over, if and when it happens.On famine. True, the technological revolution created a new reality so that we now produce enough food to fill every stomach on this planet with junk food, or at least with sufficient carbs, proteins and fats, and micronutrients, and even overfeed people, which has become the new epidemic. But has the threat of famine been abolished? No, it has not. Please google ""Katrina New Orleans starvation"". Do I need to say more?When hurricane Sandy hit NYC a few years ago the gasoline supply collapsed and gas stations in the city were mostly closed for about a week or so. It became difficult to go to work, as subways were partially closed and I was running out of gasoline for my car. Trucks are supplying this city with all the food on the shelves, and the shelves started looking a little empty. Famine did not begin, but for everyone who was there it was an illustration of how things can be and how quickly they can become that way.On plague. Oh boy! Did we not just experience Ebola? How about SARS a few years ago? And the never ending dangers of an influenza pandemic? And the risks of weaponized epidemics of infectious disease in the case of war? Yes, plague itself has not been a problem recently, except a few cases here and there in the southwest US, but to assume that an epidemic or pandemic with death on a grand scale is not possible is just plain ignorant. It is actually beyond ignorant. The absence of such events can be credited to the existence and continues efforts of the CDC, WHO and similar organizations, and many times pure luck. No, plague did not disappear, on the contrary, the emergence of new infectious diseases and their rapid spread is a danger at any time, and requires constant alertness, funding and effort to suppress it, and it all may not work to prevent death on a mass scale when it happens.On dataism. Well, the author, an obvious atheist, has found his new religion and so he is preaching it to the best of his ability. Not being an atheist myself, he has failed to turn me into a believer of this new religion. Sorry, I just do not feel like a data-processing unit and do not think all living beings are either.The there are curious omissions in this work. Global warming, for example. By 2050 we will start seeing temperatures that will begin to make the southern parts of the US and Europe uninhabitable, and this will accelerate by 2100, when the populations will have to move  higher up the northern hemisphere to survive. What this will do to war, famine and plague is anyone's guess, but this is likely to bring them back on a grander scale than ever seen before.Anyway, let me stop here. Enjoy this entertaining book of (science) fiction. I had fun reading it, and so will likely you.I am currently waiting for the publication of a book at the end of January 2018 on the expected reversal of our planet's magnetic poles, an event that has the potential to turn all electronic devices into useless bricks (The Spinning Magnet by Alanna Mitchell ). When that magnetic event happens, Homo Deus will definitely be obsolete as a book. Until that time the author will probably be a millionaire and well-prepared to be able to avoid the expected war, famine and plague that will accompany that event on this planet, and that will also be the end of his beloved Dataism.

  An algorithm is a step used in a calculation, to resolve a problem and to reach a decision.Chapter 3 contains words regarding the human soul but there is zero evidence that sapiens have souls.  Devout monotheists intensively dispute this idiom.During Martin Luther's reign in the sixteenth century fearful sinners were promised salvation by paying ten gold coins to the Church to insure a gateway to heaven.  Page 299 displays a portrait of Virgin Mary with baby Jesus.  Biblical virginity is depicted as an ultimate virtue while reproductive uncontrolled passions predate civilizations in all species as exemplified in humanity's trajectory of 9 billion souls by mid-century.Oxford futurists estimate that computer algorithms could put 47 percent of U.S. jobs in jeopardy within twenty years.  Google and its allies will have access to all health and medical records inside a system that monitors bank records, heart rate, sugar levels and sexual proclivities, just for starters.

  I was pleased that Harari included a synopsis of his ""Homo Sapiens"" in this book; I had read it a sufficiently long time before I started ""Homo Deus"", so that refreshing my memory of it was welcome. What I think worked best for me about this volume was the tone of the author's exposition; he writes like an erudite economist, in the sense that, whether an idea is likely to be emotionally loaded, controversial, or upsetting to many readers, he plunges ahead with what he has to say about it in exquisite detail, reasoning about its features with care and precision. His connection of the notion that it was story-telling that was the catalyst for the development of civilizations as we know them today was greatly compelling for me, and served to connect many different aspects of what we understand of it as manifested today. That he then wonders aloud why Sapiens should view ourselves as the be-all and end-all of evolution is a valuable spur to what he has to offer for analyses of the alternatives of what could be expected to develop next. These aren't, for the most part, especially attractive, but that seems to me to accord with our present reality. I don't know if I would say that he ends on a positive note, but I wasn't unhappy about the thoroughness of his assessments about our future; I would personally rather hear a wide range of believable scenarios than I I would a concentration on a few, perhaps more attractive examples. Fine book, by an excellent, readable author. I cannot recommend it more highly, especially when accompanied by its predecessor, ""Homo Sapiens"".

  Harari writes with strong opinions, and so it is easy to find areas to disagree on. The discussion of humanism is missing some arguments, and his review of contemporary ""Dataism"" undervalues the role of humans in shaping social media tools like Facebook. But the point of a great book is to encourage discussion, and Homo Deus does not disappoint. This is a book I'm going to recommend to people again and again.A note on the hardcover edition: it's heavy! The book is printed on heavy, glossy paper, so it's a beast of a book to hold and read. Personally, I liked the thick paper because highlighting was made easier and the photographs look beautiful. But if I had to travel with this or wasn't reading in bed, I might opt for the paperback.

  Author presents multiple scenarios of directions humans will take.  Perhaps we will engineer ourselves to become immortal, but only the wealthy will be able to afford to have themselves adapted. The rest of us would be out of luck. Also author discusses AI and potential for AI to take over our species. Due to extinction of manual jobs, there could be a huge class of useless people, just living off payments from the government and unable to contribute to society because they aren’t intelligent or educated enough. Overall I left the book with a feeling of despair because it seems likely that humans in the future will very quickly evolve both in the Darwinian way and in the technological way, to be so different from humans of today, they will be like a different species. So in a sense humans will become extinct after all, because down the line they will become superhumans who will think of their ancestors (us) as really dumb and backwards. I am the same kind of animal as my human ancestors of a million years age. But my descendants of a thousand, or maybe only a hundred, years in the future will not be human like me. There is no place in the future for regular people.

  As a fan of Yuval Harari, I had just read Sapiens before starting this book. The entire first half to two thirds of Homo Deus rehashed many of the same arguments in Sapiens -- some in greater depth and some in less. The real meat of this book, and the concept of Homo Deus, is actually only introduced at the very end when Harari talks about how artificial intelligence will transform our ethics structure.What stuck with me the most from reading this book is how AI could threaten to overturn humanism, the dominant school of though in Western elite ideals. Humanism, in short, is that human life is sacred. Humans are unique individuals who are capable of so much, and are therefore guaranteed protections and liberties.If, however, AI can perform most to all tasks better than humans, then how can human life be any more sacred than an animal's? If a lot of humanity no longer needs to work or perform productive tasks, and can in essence spend most of their time in virtual worlds, is humanism / individualism really that convincing?Harari continuously makes many interesting and subtle points about our anthropological history and our assumed moral compasses. This book is a wonderland of thought pieces.

  Harari examines where biotech, big data and artificial intelligence are taking us, taking on issues that practically no one has been willing to discuss. For that reason, it's a hugely important book.Some of the reviews -- including the one by Bill Gates -- misinterpret  Harari's presentation of Dataism as approval. Yet in the last paragraph, arguably the most important of the book, in which he poses three takeaway questions: Here are two: 1) Are organisms really just algorithms? 2) Is intelligence more valuable than consciousness?I found this book stimulating and disturbing. I read Part 3 several times. Then I looked up Harari on Wikipedia, and learned that he is a practitioner of Vipassana yoga, which is about seeing things as they are and getting to the root of the mind-body connection. He is a vegan who opposes industrial animal husbandry as cruel. Also, he doesn't own an iPhone. Taken as possible clues to his convictions, I don't believe he sees organisms as mere algorithms. I am hoping that Harari's next work will be about discoveries about consciousness.Homo Deus is not a comfortable book to read. Humans are painted in bleak colors: having driven animals deemed lesser into extinction, humans now are rushing headlong to their own destruction in a Brave New World in which algorithms decide everything. Truly, I prefer reading the Boy Scout Handbook. But if you read one book in 2017, it should be Homo Deus.

  An excellent follow up to Sapiens, Homo Deus takes us into considering some of the dystopian aspects of where civilization might end up going.  As with Sapiens, the writing is clear and clever and the subject matter is very thoughtful.  The author gives overview of how we got here, aspects of how humanity views its place in the world, perspectives on how our understanding is limited and questions regarding how sustainable our current path is.  The book is split into three main parts: Homo Sapiens Conquers the World, Homo Sapiens Gives Meaning to the World. Homo Sapiens Loses Control.It has been a while since I read Sapiens so my memory is a bit faded, but I believe Homo Sapiens Conquers the world continues in spirit with Sapiens by discussing our history of effectively conquering the natural world.  The author discusses how we have narrowed bio-diversity and changed the global ecosystem substantially as we have moved to large scale civilization building.  The author discusses at some length the moral pedestal that the majority of humanity has put itself on.  In particular how there is an elevated status of humans over other creature that is implicit in the way that we act and are willing to organize resources.  Some of it is explicit in the laws we have on right to slaughter livestock for food but much of it is implicit.  The author makes the case that it is based on the belief that humans uniquely have souls.  Furthermore the case is made that this focus on the soul arrived with monotheism and it seems as though a correspondence was formed as we went from hunter gatherers to agricultural, when we went to effectively subjugating livestock.  The author spends time on the soul thesis and, like sapiens asks some uncomfortable questions for those who believe in the soul.The author then spends time on the evolution of how humans view themselves and their relationship with the world.  The author starts with describing how we have more layers of reality due to evolved consciousness.  We started out by exercising that cognition through story telling and constructing gods to make sense of the world.  There was a limit to how much knowledge could be accumulated through the word of mouth but eventually writing was discovered and religion started becoming organized.  The author discusses how religion made sense of the world and focused attention while giving answers.  The author then gets into some rather deep topics of religion and science and tries to frame what they do and how people view them  The author gives narratives that remind people that people have used religion in ways that seem evil today and our context of write and wrong is fluid in time.  The author spends time discussing how there is a limit to how science can interpret itself.  In particular he establishes that value judgments on the results of science require a value system that at some point cannot be analyzed by science.  This idea is an important one for the author as it acts as a foundation to questioning the drawing of conclusions based on more and more data mining.  The author then spends a lot of time discussing how we went from looking to religion for answers to focusing on human experience and individuality instead, especially as scientific advances replaced certain religious beliefs.  In particular the author discusses how humanism and focus on liberty has defined much of the last several hundred years including the large conflicts 20th century conflicts.  Today most philosophies of government are based off ideas about how best to govern people, some are more libertarian in nature while others are more utilitarian but they all attempt to focus on human benefit (rather than appeasing the gods).The author then moves from the humanist revolution to the world of today where we are still trying to figure out what our philosophy really is.  The author discusses some dystopian takes on current trends in biology and artificial intelligence.  In particular the author highlights our philosophies of the 20th century are obsolete in practice in the 21st century.  Our free will which was the foundation of the empowering of humans is being questioned scientifically and practically we are using technology to decide for us more and more.  The author then goes into how the growth of AI is encroaching on areas of expertise formerly assumed to require people and how this will make many people less relevant, these too will challenge the liberal order as economic opportunities diverge but people will still have the right to vote.  The author then spends time contemplating our new infatuation with data and the new religions of the world are Facebook and Google.Homo Deus is a thoughtful continuation of Sapiens.  The author considers how many of the ideas which have been defining for the human order of the last several hundred years are becoming obsolete and we have yet to reconcile.  There is definitely much to think about and as well be concerned about and the book offers no answers as- there are no answers.  The book will frustrate many at times but overall its definitely a must read.

  As in Sapiens, Harrari weaves a powerful story of where we've been, where we are, and lays the groundwork for the possibilities of the future. He has distilled the important processes from the stew of data we are bombarded with daily and posed some of the questions we should be asking. I finished this book with many more questions than when I started. Home Deus is thought-provoking. Are humans truly on the path to irrelevance? Is our way of life dying through our own complicity? This is a fascinating read, but as Harrari says, these powerful forces are not deterministic. Therefore, read it within a framework of possibilities, albeit well premised ones. We still live within a world that is largely market driven, but humans are the market and that means we still have the power to guide the conversation.

  Loved the thought provoking ideas in this hard to put down book.  They forced me to reevaluate the way I see the world and what I imagined for its future. However, I also think that the book is flawed: in its commendable efforts to make complex ideas simple and understandable, the author occasionally simplified things way too much in a way that often was self-serving... I forgave all of this because of the author's clear enthusiasm and sense of urgency.  This is a book that reads as if written from a megaphone, but the ideas are extremely important. I agree with the author that once again homo sapiens is at crossroads. Whether homo deus will be the outcome is arguable and, in my opinion, unlikely.  But, I really enjoyed wrestling with this intriguing book, arguing in my head with the author and engaging my wife as I channeled the author and his sometimes strident opinions. My recommendation: do not pass this book. Read it!

  This is the follow up to his book, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, which I also really enjoyed. In Homo Deus, Harari looks ahead and speculates what changes and advancements in biology, technology, medicine, economics, etc, will bring to Human development in the not-so-distant future.Harari isn’t prophesying or stating exactly how some of the monumental changes will ultimately play out. Instead, he writes of possibilities and historical indicators, then goes from there. This really is an interesting (and often frightening) time to be alive. And so many scientific fields are advancing at full speed, makes my head spin. Will Sapiens use new knowledge to cheat death and become a-mortal? What happens when large sectors of the world economy are replaced by computers and algorithms that perform better than humans? What would a human lifespan of 150 years or more do to society?I like nonfiction that makes me want to learn more about its subject, that leaves me with other questions I can investigate. I took lots of notes (Kindle is great for that btw) and have plenty to think about and explore. Both of these books scored with me. Recommended.

  WOW! wish I could make this mandatory reading!  A very honest look at what is coming down the pike for us as humans and what has already pretty much gone down the drain.  Too bad humans, you had such potential.  Selfishness and greed can only last so many years before the bill comes due.  I believe we will start paying the check now and pretty soon......mostly think of this as what the future will be, now, as I think the ship is too big to turn at this point.  But, if you want to know what it's going to look like when it all hits the fan, maybe in your spare time you can pick up this book.  I am loving it.  But, if you want to continue thinking of humans as the greatest gift to the world, don't read this book.  Sorry, I feel  like a rat in a bottle of water. The 15 minutes are up.  Read the book.

  Truthfully, I could not follow where Prof Harari led in Homo Deus. His reflections on our past are, as in Sapiens, quite breathtakingly revelatory, but his extrapolations on where our technological advances will take us seemed unconvincing to me somehow. While I loved his chillingly, thrillingly amoral regard for humanity and his cynicism on liberal humanism as the religious worship of humans, it made for a bleak dystopian view on our future that felt too much like a doomsday prophesy. Still, an intriguing wander down some dark paths that affords a lot of perspective-tilting angles on our present world and possible futures. Worth the read.

  If you ever wanted to slit your wrists, I can't think of a better inspiration than ""Homo Deus"" by Yuval Harari. This is nihilism of the highest order. Do you believe in religion? It's a fantasy. Nations? Just lines on a map. Enjoy your job? Enjoy it while you can, because automation's going to take it shortly. Ok, but you're still a unique individual, right? Sorry, but you're really nothing but a biochemical sponge animated by electrical impulses. Thoughts...feelings...just blips in the brain that will be hacked and manipulated. It's slightly confusing because Harari's written another book that's supposed to deal with the present, but if his projected future is correct, there's no point to trying to do anything. Nothing can change the shape of things to come, as they once sang. Even art has been invaded by HAL. Computers can now produce classical music indistinguishable from the human-produced kind. Art, writing...as if there wasn't enough competition already. But here's the thing. Computers are good at learning the rules of things that have already been created. They can beat people at Chess and Go, but could they have created Chess and Go? Sure they can copy forms, but if they create something away from human-based forms, how are they going to know it's any good? Is Siri going to ask Bixby what they think of it? It may be the last thing that seperates us from the machines, and it may not be enough to save us if Harari is right, but everything that came before them was created by humans, not them. He thinks the problem with science fiction is that it has happy endings. Ok, so if things are that bad, isn't he saying just get it over with? What's the point of fighting? As a depressing recap of man's sins, you'll hardly find better. As an inspiration to try and create a better future? Let's put it this way. If he was a sports coach, his teams would be zero to infinity...

  I’ve read Harari’s ""Homo Deus"" and here is what I want you, folks, to know. In addition to his two books, which I’ve read very carefully, I’ve also read and listened to many of his articles and speeches. My conclusion about this author is sad: Harari is a little monster which is quite worthy of his era, and his primitive worldview is based on a mixture of poorly understood science and Buddhism. Although he says many reasonable things about our history, the current situation and the possible future that are really worth hearing, the basic ideas of his worldview are as primitive as they are destructive: from the point of view of Harari, we are nothing more than deterministic mechanisms in which there are no freedom and conscience of Existenz, no mystery of Transcendence, but only rotating gears of physical processes that supposedly create consciousness and all its phenomena - the whole reality of our individual existence. In short, according to Harari, you have no soul, no freedom, no God, you are nothing but algorithms. This is materialism brought to its absurd conclusion.I am not at all surprised that Harari is so popular among the world's elite - this is the thinker who perfectly embodies modern Kali-Yuga and perfectly brainwashes the crowd to preserve the status quo. I am also not surprised that Harari has never mentioned in his books the contemporary renaissance of scientific research of entheogens in the largest universities and the fantastic results of these studies which are mentioned by all the major media and bestselling authors like Michael Pollan. Why isn't Harari talking about it? Because these studies refute his primitive worldview, same as the works of contemporary idealists refute it, including, notably, the works of Bernardo Kastrup.I feel very sorry for people who, while reading Harari, perceive his statements uncritically, without separating the seeds from the chaff. This perception not only does not benefit from reading his books, but it is also detrimental, especially when it comes to children and young people. So here is my advice to all parents: do not let your children to the books of Harari without warning about the need for extremely critical perception of his ideas. Do not let this demonic thinker with his destructive worldview deprive your children of faith in their freedom and moral responsibility, in the possibility of an entirely different, much more beautiful worldview and the future of our world.

  Unlike his previous book Sapiens in which 80% of the content was stimulating and thoughtful and only the closing segments insufficiently considered, this new book contains little of interest and a great deal that is disappointing.Harari acknowledges early on the difficulties of gazing forward; we always amplify what's apparent to us today and completely fail to foresee what is not already around us. Thus in the 1950s US cartoons featured flying cars with huge tail fins and boat-sized steering wheels flown by men smoking cigarettes under the admiring gaze of their submissive wives. But no 1950s cartoon envisaged the Internet, GPS-based navigation systems, or even mobile telephones.So we can forgive some of the faults of the book because they are inevitable. What is less easy to accept is the lack of deep rigorous thinking that comes as a jarring disappointment periodically throughout the book. To take one simple example, early in the second section of the book Harari argues that while science can determine that humans, being animals, require oxygen in order to remain alive only religion can determine whether or not it is acceptable to execute condemned prisoners by asphyxiation.  It's important to note that the author has defined ""religion"" as equal to ""any belief system embedded in which there is some supra-human system of values."" Thus the author more or less equates formal religion (for example, the three monotheistic mythologies derived from the Yahweh cult) with Marxism and Nationalism (a reasonable equation) but also, far more problematically, with liberal humanism in general (which he splits into the three camps that went on to dominate 20th century thought). There are of course a great many obvious problems with this proposition, not the least being that whereas formal religions (be they theistic or quasi-humanistic) are essentially static and adjust to social change with great difficulty and only over extended periods of time and at great cost, humanism is intrinsically adaptable. As an example, we are seeing the first glimmers of value in the discipline of evolutionary psychology, which helps among many other things to explain why human social groups don't descend instantly into anarchy and violence the moment some nominal authority-based creed is discarded, as endlessly claimed by traditional religionists the world over.Furthermore, unlike religions, humanism really can take on board new knowledge. Now that we know from genetic analysis that the tiny differences between black-skinned people and white-skinned people are far less important than the average difference between any two black-skinned people or the average difference between any two white-skinned people, it's difficult for a racist to claim that evolutionary theory supports racist/nationalist postures. Of course the racist/nationalist can persist in their fantasy (and generally do) but humanism itself and scientific evidence in particular do not support the proposition any more than they support the notion that Hitler was ordained by Yahweh to rule over Europe and create a ""master race."" The other important thing that liberal humanism may accomplish is, through scientific effort, elaborate the limits of human cognitive capacity. Whereas the traditional religions incorrectly assumed many things about the human mind, science is increasingly showing us the limitations of our ape-brains, evolved to solve far simpler challenges than those posed by the complex modern world in which we now live. And thus Harari's parody of the US fixation on ""my feelings"" is already out-of-date; we now know enough to understand that our feelings are, in our complex modern world that's so different from the one our ancestors evolved in, generally rather misleading and quite unhelpful. Although the average person has no knowledge of this, the average person does not bring about social change. The one thing history shows us very clearly indeed is that change is brought about by people who are very far from average and their ideas may take centuries to influence the course of ordinary human lives. So the knowledge we're beginning to develop today will have its effects many years into the future, yet that is no reason to discount it. Indeed, historians ought to be uniquely sensitive to this phenomenon. Harari does recognize how fragile our current-day fantasies are (for example, representative democracy is necessarily a good thing) but he seems not to build on this basic recognition, which is disappointing.Where he is strongest is where he was strongest in his previous book: elucidating the notion that our human capacity to exist in a world of fairy-tales is what has enabled us to cooperate on a scale impossible for creatures that live only in a mental universe bounded by reality.  His attempts to expand upon his theme, loosely connected by the notion that we can better adumbrate tomorrow if we more fully understand how we arrived at today, are insufficiently satisfying to justify the book as a whole.Harari is clearly a highly intelligent and thoughtful author and it's not impossible to imagine that with perhaps another decade or two of cogitation he will produce a work of great insight and importance. Sadly, Homo Deus is not that book.

  In Macbeth, Banquo said, “If you can look into the seeds of time, And say which grain will grow and which will not, Speak, then, to me…”  Humans (homo sapiens) have spent a lot of time and energy trying to understand and/or forecast the future.Yuval Noah Harari, author of Homo Deus, has written a very interesting, insightful and thought provoking “Brief History of Tomorrow”.  He starts by examining our past – from beginning to present day.  The historical overview is focused on the hidden drivers of human development and behavior – the religious, psychological, political and commercial forces that shaped our current world.Professor Harari then looks at some possibilities of our future world and the diminishing role individual Homo Sapiens will likely play in it.  His argument is that data will become an even increasing driver that shapes our future world.  He sounds an alarm about the possibilities of AI (artificial intelligence).There are dozens of interesting philosophical questions he raises.  Professor Harari does not suggest answers to all his questions.  His goal is to have the reader understand some issues that we rarely bring into conscious awareness and then to debate them properly.The world is changing at a very rapid pace.  Some of Mr. Harari’s assertions are works in progress – trends that are happening but not yet accepted by the majority of people.  He discusses some trends as if they have already occurred and are common practices.  Religion is the primary example.  While I agree that religion is losing its stronghold on people and may in fact be in its final life stage, it still has significant influence.The book is a fascinating read.  There are some valuable insights about the history and development of Homo Sapiens that I had not considered.  It is well written, easy to read and understand.  The chapters are a bit long, but the story does pull you in and keep you interested.You probably will not agree with all possibilities but unless we take more interest and control of our future, Homo Sapiens may become obsolete.

  In this deluge of ""facts"" I find almost nothing new, or even novel (new to me anyway). Any well read person can see that we are in the midst of a plethora of information storms.  Professor Harari tries to overwhelm us with his collection of facts, so we will not see the weakness of his thesis - if in fact, he even has one. I was not able to distill a coherent theme.

  When I begin by saying this book is heavy, it's not a hippie type remark. It actually IS very heavy for its size. When I picked it up from my doorstep I thought there must be two bricks in the box! Furthermore, the pages are hard to turn and hold open so as to read the text; they try to spring back closed and I have to keep fighting to be able to read them. I have only gotten as far as page 73 so far and already my arthritic shoulders hurt like mad and I have deep grooves in my thighs from holding the book in my lap. I'm sure I should be much further along but I keep getting distracted and annoyed at the effort it takes to wrestle with the pages! This may sound like nothing to be concerned about, but I weighed the book and it comes to 2 lbs. 3.8 oz. I recently took delivery of another book, ""Where the Crawdads Sing,"" which is the same size as ""Homo Deus"" but weighs 1 lb. 2.2 oz. I know, this doesn't sound like a rectangular bowling ball, as I regularly use hand weights to exercise that weigh 5 lb. each that don't feel very heavy. All I can say is, it's different.I like the author, Yuval Harari. He writes beautifully once you get going in the text. I do disagree with some of what he says though, which is another reason for the heavy going, because I often have to read sentences over again, although as I mentioned above, maybe it has to do with the constant struggle just to hold the darn book. Maybe with further reading and understanding, he will seem clearer, but already I have to disagree with a couple of his main points so far. He has a lot to say about the death of God and Humanism, making it sound worse than even the Republicans' disgust with Liberalism, which, by the way, is how the founders of this country believed our Republic should be. God, as anyone who reads or hears the news these days knows, is still robustly alive to a very large number of people, who are also very involved in the politics of the United States, no matter what we may think. Our insistence on ""Freedom of Religion"" enables many church goers to still feel it is their duty to ""convert"" us all to their beliefs - in God.I also disagree with Harari's statement that you can't predict the future by studying history. He says it is past, and now everything is different. I read history to understand people. Just because past kings or pharaohs fought wars differently or for different reasons, or that there used to be plagues and starvation, (which can still happen) we still know the hearts and desires of humans, and I believe we are still driven by the same natures, so we can extrapolate what thoughts and decisions could be made and lies that will be told. We just have to pay attention.As I said, I've barely begun this book, so as I go on, my objections will mellow. At least I am sure it will be interesting.

  This is an amazing book.  A very thought provoking book by Harari.  Very dense with many things to think about.  In some ways a sequel to “Sapiens”, but more of a look starting recently and into the future.  He redefines “religion” in terms of a widespread shared idea or commonality of view of society rather than a deity is the old way.  Thus, humanism (humans) is the religion rather than Gods, or, rather, humans and their feelings and thoughts are what is valued rather than  some older idea of God.  Humanism then gets analyzed and subdivided into various types of humanism.  From there, it goes on to discuss how human brains may just be designed as algorithms which could in the future be out done by computers with artificial intelligence.  Also, how we are becoming more and more involved in putting huge amounts of data into computers and how this could affect the future.  The book is very thought provoking, and like “Sapiens” will require rereading to have a chance at understanding it better.

  No God, no free will, and humans will be replaced when computers inevitably outpace our brains.  This book is a real downer, but it wasn't as much the promised look into the future as it was a chance for the author to bash religion, institutions, and the human condition. Even that could have made interesting reading except for the author's style of belaboring every major point.  I gave it three stars, just barely, and I suggest you exercise the free will the author claims you don't have, and decide for yourself whether you want to slog through this depressing diatribe.

  Another brilliant book from Yuval Noah Harari. If you liked Sapiens, you'll probably like Homo Deus as well. The author writing style is perfect: clear sentences, well constructed paragraphs, and well structured chapters. The result is a great book which provides an amazing reading experience to the reader. The subject of the book is very interesting: the possible futures for humankind. The author's point of view is very well grounded on solid research. However, being an software engineer, I think some of his views about how technology may evolve are too optimistic. Nevertheless, this doesn't compromise the message the author is sending to humanity. Great book worth every second reading it!

  Harari's books gives me so many ah-Hah's ..... I find myself underlining a sentence in every page or two. He is so full of insights, humor and a deep understanding as he explains how our world of ideas and politics, science and religion, evolution, government, culture, capitalism - everything we are and how it all works together.  AND where it came from, and where it might be headed and WHY.  There are so many new ideas and new ways of looking at his topics that I often struggle to keep up and feel overwhelmed at times. And then Poof, I'll get where he's going ahead of him as he spells out  his conclusion. And I'm so glad I read his Sapiens first and that there are a few more books by him to read after Deus.

  Note: the book looks nice and came in perfect condition. The following is a book review:Simply put the book is a regurgitation of the authors arrogant, condescending, and atheistic world view. He glosses over centuries in blurbs of disjointed sentences and paints broad historical pictures without a lick of footnotes to cite his “facts.” There are much cleverer and more academic writers who discuss the issues this author tries to describe.

  A paragraph worth thousand review words. Below are two random:On the invention of narratives by politicians:""After losing the first Isonzo battle Italian politicians had two choices. They could have admitted their mistake and offered to sign a peace treaty. Austria-Hungary had no claims against Italy and would have been delighted to make a peace treaty because it was busy fighting for its survival against the much stronger Russians. Yet how could the politicians go to the parents, wives and children of 15,000 dead Italians soldiers and tell them: 'Sorry, there has been a mistake. We hope you won't take it too hard, but your Giovanni died in vain, and so did your Marco.' Alternatively they could say: 'Giovanni and Marco were heroes! They died so that Trieste would be Italian, and we will make sure they didn't die in vain. We will go on fighting until victory is ours!' Not surprisingly, the politicians preferred the second option. So they fought a second battle, and lost another 40,000 men. The politicians again decided it would be best to keep on fighting, because 'our boys didn't die in vain' ""...Inventing narratives is not confined to the politician:""We see then that the self too is an imaginary story, just like nations, gods and money. Each of us has a sophisticated system that throws away most of our experiences, keeps only a few choice samples, mixes them up with bits from movies we've seen, novels we've read, speeches we've heard, and daydreams we've savored, and out of all that jumble it weaves a seemingly coherent story about who I am, where I came from and where I am going. This story tells me what to love, whom to hate and what to do with myself. This story may even cause me to sacrifice my life, if that's what the plot requires. We all have our gender. Some people live a tragedy, others inhabit a never-ending religious drama, some approach life as if it were an action film, and not a few act as if in a comedy. But in the end, they are all just stories. ""In short, this book is a must!

  Harari's book is thought-compelling and deserving of all the bright reviews it has garnered.  However, I come away thinking that as we are all amazed and awed by the advances in IT and AI we have witnessed over the past 50 years, the Kevin Kelly-style wet dreaming about the possible link between technology and organic evolution has gotten way overblown, and, I think Harari falls into this conceptual trap. I'm not convinced organic processes are really ""algorithmic"" since our understanding of the phenomenological nature of consciousness in an empirical sense, is for all practical purposes, next to zero.  Our progress on the development of AI is nowhere near the fantasy level Harari conjures up. He seems to place a lot of faith in the eventual perfection of algorithmic processing of data to the point of Sapien evolutionary re-selection, but we all know of algorithms, as Will Rogers once said of us humble Sapiens, ""It isn't what we don't know that gives us trouble, it's what we know that ain't so.""  I suppose notable historians these days are now futurists, but sometimes we learn more from carefully excavating the past.  When my grandmother, a rural housewife with no more than a ninth grade education watched her neighbors marvel at the first television placed in a living room of her small countryside community, her young niece looked to her delighted and asked, ""What do you thing Auntie?""  ""Looks like a 'want box"" to me,"" my granny responded.  And much it is with the machinations of the Internet in general.  I know I am benefiting and suffering greatly from IT and AI, but I won't hold my breath for technology to rearrange my genome anytime soon.  I will grab a hold of my wallet though.

Similarly in many countries around the world, including the USA and the UK, witnesses in courts put their hands on a bible when swearing to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

  This book is for everybody from students to parents and grandparents! With automation, cyborgs, robots and algorithms running our lives while we text away it lays bare an architecture that essentially spells the most amazing technological feats you can imagine. Yet there is a missing element in the wonders of technology and dataism that are coming every month: where does humanity fit into all of this? Is it possible to call a halt while humans decide where to take all this? Or will any such halt be overruled by corporations, the biggest benefactors of all this? After you read this amazingly lucid book written by a mind as crystal clear as the Mediterranean, you will either be thankful that you won't  be around when biological and technological algorithms take god's (if there is any such person) place or you will spread the word to your kids and grandkids that Harari's book is a must to prepare for the future if they don't want to become a new class of humans that Harari calls the ""Useless Class"" -- aka of no use for anything. Even if half of it comes true, home sapiens are doomed the same as Neanderrthals who we pushed to extinction! Maybe we deserve it. After all we pushed out the other forms of life to a lesser position and became the supremos, the Homo Sapiens!

  Hearing first about this from Amazon, I had not read any other work by Yuval Noah Harari.  Thinking critically is required in my opinion, as the author presents various belief structures. If you read Neil Gaiman's fiction work, American Gods, in which television and other material goods become objects of faith, then you will appreciate a similar thread in Mr. Harari's non-fictional account of religions such as the religions of capitalism, socialism, communism, and christianity [I use lower case for all]. For awhile as I read I believed that the author was pushing one over the other, but I think that he explains them as belief systems, positive and negative, letting the reader choose for themselves. I enjoy works that make me think, and this one had me slowing down for that many times. I'll probably read other of this author's work now.

  Harari is a good writer, but I often find the way he forms his arguments in this book to be a bit frustrating. It's true that he says none of these are ""prophecies"" but possibilities. On the other hand, these scenarios must not be too improbable or else they wouldn't even be worth talking about.Anyway, Harari lays out the progress humanity has made, and points out that the future may have some radical changes that will not allow the same paradigm that got us here to continue forward.What I find frustrating is that he lays out definitions and arguments that without a few caveats are way too broad.For example he has his own definition of humanism, and says things like ""while theists worship theos (Greek for 'god'), humanists worship humans"". If all that is meant by worship is afforded great respect, then sure, but it certainly seems like humanists do not worship humans like theists worship God (something I would think both theists and humanists would agree on). I'd prefer that he acknowledge that sometimes when he uses words, he isn't using them as we would colloquially use them.As an aside, I'd say he botches a concept in quantum mechanics by off-handedly saying that it allows ""a cat can be both alive and dead at the same time"" which is not what quantum mechanics says. The cat's state may be in a superposition of alive and dead to a particular observer, but that doesn't mean it is both alive and dead at the same time. Certainly, to the cat, it is never both alive and dead.Harari also makes statements that don't seem like they could be knowable. Like robots do not feel things and that animals and humans do. I have no idea how he can know this. This is especially confusing since he even brings up the problem that we cannot know if other beings are conscious, because we cannot be sure anyone else feels anything (the problem of other minds). I certainly understand that in all probability animals are more likely to have a consciousness similar to humans in some way and robots probably do not, but I would prefer Harari just say it that way and explain why.I also just don't find all of his arguments convincing on consciousness as they seem merely to be assertions that we experience things and it isn't clear why we feel an experience. I simply am not sure that there is ""more"" than saying that people feel things because of reactions in their brains. Harari and many others point out that this doesn't explain why we actually experience things, but I simply don't know that this is a big problem. If we could predict exactly what you are thinking and will do from your brain state, then I don't see why it's so important to understand the ""experience"" of those brain states to have understanding.As an example Harari states ""'anger' isn't an abstract term we have decided to use as a shorthand for billions of electric brain signals. Anger is an extremely concrete experience which people were familiar with long before they knew anything about electricity."" I think people knew what pressure was before the discovery of statistical mechanics, but that doesn't change the fact that pressure is a shorthand for billions and billions of molecules reflecting off of a surface. Maybe anger isn't like that, but Harari doesn't provide any reason it must not be a shorthand.Harari also gives a lot of credence to computers getting to know us amazingly well through better computational power, algorithms, and data. I think he often overreaches with this argument, but he's free to explore this possibility. I just wish he'd put caveats on the things he presents. For example he talks about Google Flu Trends, but Google Flu Trends turned out to systematically overpredict flu outbreaks (which I think Harari should have known as the July 2014 Wikipedia entry talks about the problems with the data). The CDC data turned out to be better (though CDC and Google data together did much better), as you can discover by googling google flu trends failure. This is of course just one example, but I think many of the examples Harari gives have similar caveats. They might have amazing power some day, but it seems a lot farther off than Harari acknowledges (at least to me).As one final example, that gives you a flavor of why I found the book frustrating, even if I found it insightful, is his talk of the ""modern deal"". We're told it requires us to give up meaning for power.But later Harari says ""The modern deal offers us power, on condition that we renounce our belief in a great cosmic plan that gives meaning to life. Yet when you examine the deal closely, you find a cunning escape clause"". It's not much of a deal if you simply get power in exchange for nothing.I might add more examples some day, but honestly, I think this gives the gist of what I didn't like. The good is that Harari writes clearly, and lays out his arguments systematically, so that you can easily evaluate them yourself. The advantage of his method is that he brings out points of view that are not commonly stated in such an obvious and systematic way. While I disagree with some of his interpretations, Harari does lay out most of the problems of consciousness well, and explores possibilities well if machines become super-intelligent without consciousness.

  Introduction and conclusion may be a little hard to grasp, but the central descriptions are quite fascinating.I would have given 5 stars if Dr Harare had not left consciousness unexplained, but theorized that it could be an algorithmic device to classify and attribute value to perceptions.An example of classification is color. Examples of value are pain vs pleasure, joy vs sadness, hope vs fear, good vs bad.Values are relative to the ultimate goal of the algorithm: to expand and perpetuate. They are output from the consciousness algorithm to enhance the performance of behavioral algorithms. An example of dysfunction in the consciousness device is depression leading to suicide: the output value is abnormally skewed towards pain/sadness and decreases the performance of behavioral algorithms instead of enhancing it. Another example is fear induced panic.This theory would explain why consciousness can easily be altered by drugs, be it for sedation or psychedelic trip. And how robots could acquire a conscience.

  This book predicts the future of humanity, yet most of the book is about the past. The first part of the book talked about the future, and then the book turned to the past. Half the book is about human history (with a lot of science intermingled), where the trends of the past are used to make very provocative predictions for the future. The author is so interesting, and history comes alive and is relevant. If you have strong views on religion and the meaning of life, this book might challenge you in uncomfortable ways. The author makes very persuasive arguments. The only one I could not buy was his final argument on Dataism. This is the kind of book that you will read and want to talk to people about. My one criticism is that the middle part of the book seemed a little stretched out, and I got a little impatient to get back to the future. Still, I am so glad I read this.

  . . . I took off a half-star for the actual, physical book itself. I discovered, quite by accident, that you can literally erase words off the pages. Whether or not this is because of a third world paper company or cheap ink I don't know. But anyway, that one’s on HarperCollins. The other half-star star is because of his very confusing use of the word “liberal”. He mentioned the word “Conservatives” (p 286) once, but that was for a political party and it’s not even in the index.The term “liberal humanism / liberalism” is scattered throughout the book and all over the place with its own listing in the index. After a very careful reading of the entire book I still don’t know what he means by the term “liberal” and I’d be willing to bet my life that 47% of the people who voted for Obama twice probably don’t know what it means it either. “For liberalism…,”  he says, “believes in individualism,” (p 332). Really? I thought it was group-think. Try explaining that one to Ann Coulter. And then, on p 351 like a baseball bat upside the head, he hits me with, “Liberalism… favours liberty over equality.”  Wow. Like, double wow. Triple wow, even, maybe. I’ll let Condoleezza Rice figure that one out. The reason it’s highly possible, maybe even likely, that he may have a totally different, academic definition of “liberal” is that on p 265 he did characterize the beacon of enlightenment in California as the “People’s Republic of Berkeley.” So it’s entirely possible that his definition, or understanding at least, of liberalism is rooted in the literature of individual 18th and 19th century philosophers and not Al Sharpton. Just sayin'.Other than that, what a great book!!! His presentation of past historical events and the way they shaped the world we live in today is nothing short of brilliant. The last, or third, part of the book is the scary part we all need to be forewarned about and individually prepared for. I’m seriously thinking about converting from being an Episcopalian to a Mormon and getting myself a 100 year supply of canned food and living in a cave somewhere for the rest of my life. Hopefully, I can find a sexy cyborg robot who can help me live for ever, which is what he says is supposed to happen...

  This book is an extrapolation of the first Harari's book on the history of mankind (Saoiens). In that book, Harari presented many provocative and intelligent ideas. That book was a huge editorial success.The present text is well written, intelligent, easy to read and full of provocative ideas. In this sense, it is worthwhile reading.My difficulty with the book is that Harari is a historian. He applies to his (or others) research data, methods of interpretation and analysis. You may agree or disagree with the interpretation of the facts, but the facts remain. In a prediction of the future, you have no data from the future. Therefore,  the author extrapolates from past and present data. Being Harari extremely intelligent, his extrapolations and predictions are plausible. In some cases, he simply reads the facts of the present with an historic perspective. It is often true that the future is already contained in the present but we fail to see it.All in all, an intelligent but arbitrary book. If a nuclear conflagration would start tomorrow, all predictions will instantly evaporate. A radically new technology may change mostly everything, but no one would be able to predict it one hour before it was discovered.Jorge Urzua M.D.Santiago de Chile

  This author is wonderful. This present book is the weakest of his three... but it is still worth a serious read. Not unlike a number of his colleagues in the ""God is no longer a necessary hypothesis"" school (Hawkins et al)-- he is much better as intellectual/scientist/historian -- than Theologian. Personally, I resonate with most of his critiques of the current (formal) world religious establishments. However, there is more than a little hubris, I believe, in his apparent belief/affirmation that this is all there is. In a word, if you can't see it, touch it, smell it, hear it, image it, radiate it... it ain't. We know a lot. We are learning more -- but I do believe that the more we learn, the less we know we know. Or something. But still... Great read.

  This is the kind of book that will make you think beyond socially preconceived notions. The author provides plenty of analogies that confirm his points. He dissects everything so it is easily understandable. He will make you question reality, what makes us human, where is humanity going, along some other fundamental questions.I particularly liked how the author discusses what makes humans such emotional beings when we could function perfectly fine biologically without emotions, everything would be automated.His theories about the future also make a lot of sense specially since he backs it up with patterns seen in the past.The one think I didn’t like was how he was so certain of some statements when in reality nobody can know for sure. Specially regarding the existence of a soul, still a great book that will keep you thinking.

  The assumption that God does not exist is one of the foundations of humanism. But the God of the Bible is not the distant, grumpy, straw-god Harari describes. Humanists are right—that god does not exist. The real God is He who defeated human’s two biggest problems on the cross: death and evil (evidenced as sin in the human race). All suffering comes from evil and death. Picking a few odd verses from the Old Testament and scoffing at them is quite different from studying the entire Gospel of John. Christ had no money, led no army, held no political position, yet He was and is the most influential human in history. Why? Because He is who He says He is. Deus in the flesh. His power was spiritual; His power was and is unseen. Dr. Stephen Covey’s best quote was likely: “We don’t see the world the way it is, we see it the way we are.” Humanists basically say, “Gee, I really wish reality were different from what it is…I wish it were like this or that…and I wish it was centered on me, and I will somehow will it to be that way whether it makes sense or not.” Homo Deus is a 21st century humanist’s bible. Dr. Harari is a humanist priest and prophet because he tells their story—he is part of their elite. Homo Deus is a good example of a brilliant mind whose train is on the wrong tracks and whose beginning assumptions make the train’s direction veer off course the more long-winded rationalities and tangents he adds. In the end, Dr. Harari uses 150,000 words to tell us 15,000 words of insightful information. He doesn’t weave a tale as much as twist an argument using a stream of almost endless rationales and tortured arguments. He uses a lot of words admitting we really don’t know a lot of things for certain. Is this the best humanist Bible available today? If so, it doesn’t quite live up to its nervy title. The humanists’ bleak conclusion remains this: “If you come from nothing, and will go to nothing, you are nothing.” Attempting to make up meaning with lofty words as you go along doesn’t work, and living a longer meaningless life is, well, meaningless. But life does have meaning, it has purpose—it has meaning and purpose now because it’s always had meaning and purpose. Part of purpose is responsibility. We are responsible for our actions, for this world and for our fellow man. We are responsible for each other and to each other. We are responsible to God because we are sons and daughters of God and each one of us has great value. We can’ t live without godly things—absolute godly things. Humans were made to love, were made to seek joy, goodness, beauty, and truth. You can’t have these godly things without God, and we desire godly things because we were made with eternal souls in His image. When the humanist reaches for godly things he can never quite grab them because his reach is disingenuous—he grabs hold of only the shadow of the godly thing—it feel authentic for a moment and then fades away. Homo Deus will never replace Christus Deus et homo est… Christ is genuine God and genuine human. We can never be gods…but we can be His sons and daughters. Humanity’s biggest problems are evil/sin and death—all suffering comes from these two. Christ took both those problems head-on while hanging on the cross. His resurrection was proof He defeated them. Humanism is a construct. It is self-made religion. It didn’t come about through scientific methods, objective reason, or evidence. It was created using will and assumptions. Humanism didn’t change the times, it was a sign of them—it merely reflected the times. Homo Deus is humanism’s most recent attempt to grab the apple. But its complex attempt tries too hard and comes up lame. “If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.” Albert Einstein. The most valuable bits in this book are its tracking genetic and techno advancements and attempting to see where they may take us in the next few decades—for better or worse. We don’t need humanism to take that journey, we need faith.

  The book is thoughtful and outside the box, an interesting take on where humanity may be headed and how algorithms may control our future.  Sometimes the author stretched the bounds of credulity, but perhaps on some occasions I was not smart enough to connect the dots. At times I thought the author was surprisingly traditional and short-sighted.  For example, he criticizes people to take pictures and share them on social media while at an event because they are missing ""the experience"".  For some people, taking and sharing pictures IS ""the experience"".  Open your mind.  Also, the ability to easily and quickly take pictures with smartphones has added immeasurable value to our lives.  I'm 51 and when I was a kid, you were deliberate about taking pictures because you only had so much film and it cost money to buy film and develop pictures.  I do not have pictures of most events from my pre-40 years.  However, now I have great pictures of virtually every significant event I go to.  Those are great memories.  Did I miss ""the experience"" taking pictures?  Certainly not.Anyway, if you like outside the box thinking and are up for an interesting view on where we may be headed, you will enjoy this book. Be sure to read my next review about the horrible keyboard I bought on Amazon.  Just typed a paragraph and lost it due to the nonresponsive keyboard. :)

  This book stands with Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance and Future Shock as catching the front end of the next wave of our scientific, economic, and political future. As Yuval Noah Harari notes, these three factors are the way Homo Sapiens have moved audaciously through time to sit where we are today. But, sit, we do not. We are moving much faster than the vast numbers of folks are aware; those who read will get a chill of fear and a shiver of expectation for how we are developing. This will help you prepare. Use this knowledge to help your community prepare. Knowledge will lead the way. We are an information economy, but that is changing.

  This reading experience was reminiscent of reading other nonfiction books that tell stories of ideas and patterns that are connected across time. It can be manic in stretches.  Here, the story unfolds into an intersection of evolving technologies in biology and computer science, and the conclusion is that this convergence will likely improve human experience, and prolong, replicate, and perhaps eventually enslave or destroy human life. In any event, it will change everything as well as the stories we tell ourselves.Decoding the genome and coding AI are the two most promising and risky human endeavors; when combined with ever increasing data processing capabilities, they threaten to bring about a post-human future.  The book is more dystopian than it has to be but there are real causes for concern. There is plenty to take issue with (and I may come back later and elaborate) but there is much more to spark thinking about important and interesting topics.

  The author's previous work, Sapiens, was insightful and delightful. His more recent work, Homo Deus, pales in comparison. The author is evidently an excellent historian and perhaps anthropologist. When he ventures into the realms of science, philosophy and psychology, his second piece of work is unimpressive.The most interesting part of the book has to do with the development of humanism and its three different sects. He is excellent when he writes as an historian.Throughout the book, he uses science to disprove the existence of such things as free will and an eternal soul. However, in doing so, he often applies a fallacious dichotomising logic: it is either all or none, this or that, left or right. For example, having regard to scientific advances in the workings of the brain with scientists being able to apply stimulation to different parts of the brain to arrive at predicted behavioural results, he concludes that the human mind is nothing but biochemistry and electrical impulses. The fallacy of this logic can be illustrated by a classic example in physics. Early in the 20th century, physicists who had an excellent grasp of the wave properties of light (and who thought light was nothing but waves) were perplexed when experimental breakthrough showed that light exhibited properties of particles. What appeared initially as a paradox eventually became accepted as the wave-particle duality of light in physics. Against this background, I find the author's use of the term ""scientific dogma"" here and there in this book when he discusses scientific theories not only distasteful, but a reflection of a fundamental misunderstanding of what science is about.The final chapter discusses ""dataism.""  Undoubtedly, the tremendous pace at which information technology and artificial intelligence is advancing gives great prominence to data processing and information flow. Nevertheless, to raise the subject to the level of an ideology is really putting the cart before the horse. To say that ""information wants to be free"" is really quite ludicrous.Although on the final page of the final chapter, the author says he intends to make the reader aware of different possibilities for the future, the thrust of his preceding discussion points in a single direction: that of dataism.Although the book covers an important and most interesting subject, I find it rather disappointing.

  Prof. Harari explores the future of humankind, jumping off from his insights from his first book Sapiens and aligning it with current studies and trends drawn from our increasingly data-centric world. The theme of humankind evolving into either gods or mere processors for the Internet of All Things has been explored by many science fiction books. But Prof. Harari enumerates the milestones and instances we may be actually heading into that eventuality. An enjoyable read, Prof. Harari keeps it light with funny analogies and anecdotes. However, it tends to get rambling in some sections, sometimes repeating points already made clear in previous chapters.

  This book is like reading a sophomore's rambling writing in a bachelor's degree philosophy class. I've read it once and listened to it twice, and I simply cannot find the excitement in it that others seem to find. Glittering and overly dramatic generalities abound.

  This must be a book written by passing mass of biased information through an algorithm. The only merit for this book is clever marketing, including  Amazon's dishonest bundling with other worthwhile books, so that the recommendation of one becomes a recommendation for each in the bundle. I feel a break in trust when Fareed Zakaria recommends a book in a bundle that includes his own book and books he very likely has not read. If you expect to reach some  great insight into our future you will be  disappointed. If you intend to read this book make sure you are strong in your intelligence, faith and hopes for Humankind, and make sure you do not find yourself walking through a valley of depression and of shadows of death, else the book may prove too painful  for you.  The book is not brief nor could it be a history of tomorrow. in fact it is hard to determine its purpose and motivation, other than to say we have so far been unkind to animals,  and to have a book to sell.

  The book was very enjoyable but also a real eye-opener.Not only does it sum up our history since creation but it does so in a new light. One that is used to speculate about our future based on our previous behavior as a species.Some very complex & deep topics are addressed in a very captivating way. Although on the surface of things, it might feel a bit morbid at some points but I came out with a very positive outlook on our future as the human race.

  I thoroughly enjoyed Sapiens and expected a similar experience with Homo Deus.  I was pleased not to be mistaken with the first 200 or so pages.However, the balance of the book left me with the impression that the author had a 200 page book, but commercialism required a 400 page book.The last portion of the book struck me as a stream of consciousness hardly worth the author's effort.The first half is well worth the price of the book and most informative and enjoyable.

  It's much easier to write a brief history of humans than it is to write humanity's future. Harari's first book is brilliant and eye-opening. This second book is a rehash of the first with a science fiction ""what if"" scenario tacked on. His premise is that artificial intelligence will become real and overtake homo sapiens as the dominant life form. What he ignores is that all computers, networks, AI and algorithms are tools. And homo sapiens will use these tools to remake the world and ourselves. Despite this flaw, he introduces a good number of new ideas worth contemplating.

  I just received my paperback copy of this book today. Normally I would wait to leave a review until I read it but in this case, I have to warn people: the paper is some kind of high-gloss color picture paper so the book is is EXTREMELY heavy--a full 2.5 pounds! This may not seem like much, but try to hold that amount up to read for a few minutes. Your forearms will be tired in no time. I'm extremely disappointed that they chose this paper to print on. I have to have the book on my lap to read it, which limits where and when I can do so. It's not even a large size (9x6"") but it feels like a phonebook.

  This is another masterpiece based upon the solid research of Professor Harari. Many people still don't understand that we are in a momentous change, and that humanity and life will not be the same ever again. We are at the brink of being considered ""passé"", in fifty years time many of our present concepts and perceptions will be archaic as a new humanity and civilization dawn.What is even more admirable in the book is how seamlessly everything is explained and described, and how serious science appears relatively easy. A must read for almost everybody.

  Inspired and provocative, Harari looks towards the future of humankind (after his stunning reveiw of its past, with ""Sapiens"").An inspiring read, even if one does not necessarily agrees with his projections (and Harari does not expect everyone to agree!). His views about AI and the ""Singularity"" are not what one would expect, ie they are original. Pessimistic about the future, but without overplaying the fear of a machine-ran Big Brother: risk is rather that humakind slips into non-relevance, slowly and willingly... With a few superhuman winning-it-all.Another book that does not look like any other one, and, according to me, a must read.

  This is a decent follow up to his first book. As far as content goes this is probably about 40% rehash of information already talked about in Homo Sapiens. The rest being some further development of those ideas and then a little bit of new thoughts and ideas. It really feels like part 2 of a movie that isnt as good as the original.The ideas the world.is developing more and more into nothing more than a huge data processing center and that this can eliminate humankind seems very farfetched. As such the author acknowledges these are just ideas and not prophecy. But this idea is way out there. Lets say for a second the internet of all things is able to run the world as one huge algorithm. That eliminates mankind. Then what is the purpose of the internet of all things if the data it produces no longer has a consumer????

  I have read most of the book .its very interesting. I feel he has a premise and than tries to make everything fit into his view. He says g-d is dead . In fact all the enormous evidence of the existence of g-d is ignorred. Only for example . The very existence of the world . The continued creation of man and plants . The symmetry in the world . He is obviously a historian and not a scientist.  The fact that we now live better than a few thousand years ago does not mean we can ignore the wonders of this world and claim we have complete control . We don't make our hearts beat or need to be aware of our breathing. The human body is tremendously complicated . Even if we understand today a bit more about the gene, we are still a long way from creating anything organic !! I am an engineer and I know how difficult it is to invent new products . Most of my products are just metal and plastic. It can still take years to develop a product according to a defined specification .If Harrari had looked at more Jewish sources he would know that according to Jewish tradition the present world will exist for 6000 years . We have now just started the year 5779. It is obvious that this is the period where most of the advance will be . The world as we know it will cease to exist in no more than 221 years. This part actually may fit in with Harraris predictions. In short I dont feel his conclusions  are convincing. It could well be that man will destroy the world .

I always review the references and am humbled by the amount and scope of documented research that goes into the creation of a work of this magnitude.

I was happy in the end that the author reminded his readers that these are not predictions but only possibilities and the outcomes will be up to us.

  This is a really thought provoking book and I recommend it highly. I'm confused, though, about Harari's take on the new religion of Dataism. I can't figure out exactly what it is or where the threat comes from. Humans are now seeing data as not only powerful, but as the thing which gives our lives meaning. We no longer value our experiences unless we upload them to the information cloud and they get shared with and liked by others. That's one example Harari gives as proof that we worship the data cloud above all else. But is that really why people feel compelled to upload their pics and get likes? Is it because we think data is all powerful? Maybe it's just because we have this deep-seated psychological need for validation, and social media gives us instant gratification in the validation department. So I'm not sure I follow how all the sharing on social media proves that we are handing over our lives to the Internet of All Things. Then there's Harari's concerns about the point in time when AI or algorithms will know more about us than we know about ourselves. This is when Dataism will backfire on humanity and we'll not only lose any semblance of freewill, we will even become superfluous. I'm not following this argument. Is anyone else following this? I get that ceding power to algorithms has huge risks. But I can't quite make the leap from: algorithms understand us better and can make better decisions than we can by looking inward; to: algorithms won't need humans anymore at all, because algorithms will know us better than we know ourselves. I think Harari's argument for the threats of Dataism is better than I'm making it out to be. I'm just not quite getting it.

  In Homo Deus, Yuval Noah Harari brings a broad and encompassing historical view to bear on big-picture trends, dynamics and questions that are front and center in our world today, and in doing so shines a multifaceted light on what makes people what they are, how we’ve come to the place we are now and where we’re going. Starting with the omnipresent elements that threatened the survival of our ancestors and seeing how we managed those threats, Harari draws in many different threads: why we created and value religion; why we create the technology we do to address certain problems, and how our technology has evolved; the role of science in our lives; why we seek happiness and what it’s like to achieve happiness; how our relationship with the natural world has changed as we changed from hunter-gatherers to agriculturalists; the nature of the human soul; that humans are at their core emotional organisms; and so much more. The observations Harari makes and the conclusions he draws aren’t necessarily the obvious ones, but his logic and perspective and how he comes to his rationale are clear, and make for compelling reading.Accurately predicting where the human species is headed, predicting what the evolution of technology will create and predicting the political and social dynamics of future populations is impossible – there are simply too many variables being influenced by too many elements to know what’s going to happen in the future. But the predictions Harari makes in Homo Deus don’t emanate from a belief in what will happen as much as from a historian’s view of what could happen, given our story up to now and the elements we’re composed of. Homo Deus gives us a chance to deeply assess who we are and how we’ve come to where we are. It makes for fascinating, thought-provoking reading.This is an exceptional book. If you are drawn to big-picture views of humans and our place in the world, this book is valuable. Whether you agree with all that’s written here or not, what Harari has drawn together will give you many threads of valuable input, and offers much to chew on.

  One of the greatest discoveries of the scientific age was ignorance.Yuval Noah Harari casts even more light on ignorance and it’s consequences. Explaining humankind’s journey over the last 70,000 years from Hunter Gatherers to the present as presented in his book provides the reader with an experience like no other.I cannot thank him enough for his work and the impact it has had on every concept I formulated about consciousness, the past, present and future. The best review I can give is that I intend to read it over again immediately.

  I agree that the narrative perspective in this book is often sophomoric. The attack on 'humanism' is really an attack on anthropocentrism. It has nothing to do with Erasmus or Renaissance Humanism. The attack on monotheism is a logical fallacy (monotheism has become the most dominant religious posture in modern times; modern times have been indescribably cruel; monotheism is scientifically unproveable; monotheism is therefore cruel and baseless). However there are many moments of sparkle and wit: Harari is a very widely-read scholar. From what I gather he is also a fine human being. The level of his language however (this is of course aimed at the translator) is not elevated, and is at times even vulgar. It's hard to see how a book with such blemishes can stand the test of time. And in closing, all the interesting techie and scientific conundrums were already dealt with in Star Trek (the Original Series).

  I picked up this book soon after reading Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind (and I would recommend reading in that order, although it is not a prerequisite). This book continues the discussion started in the previous book, but in contrast, it (perhaps quite obviously, per its title) spends a lot of time hypothesizing about humanity's future. In doing so, it quite strictly refrains from passing any judgements or making any ethical/moral arguments - one of the beauties of these two books. It does raise very pertinent questions which give you pause and make you think, and the perspective it provides is probably something you won't articulate to yourself easily. A great read for anyone who is interested in deeper understanding of (or simply fascinated by) Humankind.

  I have to confess that I haven't read the previous book (""Sapiens: a brief history of humankind"") of this author, so the first chapters did not look repetitive to me although they might be for someone who has read Sapiens.  If you are looking for a book that tells you how the future will look like, this is not your book.  If you are looking for a book that gives you the tools to think about how the future MIGHT look like, then you will love this book as much as I do.  The book helps you to adopt a different point of view when thinking about humankind and the power of the new ""ideology"" based on algorithms and data that has developed in the XXIst century and leave you with a blank slate to imagine how our society will evolve (or disappear.)

  The value of Homo Deus by Prof. Harari, a history professor at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, is in his predictions of “what humankind will try to achieve in the twenty-first century - not what it will succeed in achieving”.His starting point is his theory that all living beings, including humans, are only driven by biochemical algorithms developed by Darwinian evolution over time. This controversial thesis takes him to collide with the concepts of soul, theism, meaning of life, religion and free will. His arguments to support this thesis, though, are not impressive; most of them are anecdotic, not grounded by in depth research and facts, sometimes simplistic and naïve. He seems to neglect or ignore centuries of history of philosophy and debates on ontological proof and arguments for the Existence of God. I am referring to the works of philosophers and mathematicians of the caliber of Anselm, Descartes, Leibnitz, or Gödel and Malcolm. Furthermore, he completely misses the concept of holism versus reductionism or self-reference when addressing self-conscience and free will. (ref. Hofstadter: Gödel, Escher, Bach).In other terms Harari’s book misses the big opportunity to link his ideas and his future projections to contemporary state of the art in philosophy, psychology, logical math, theology and biology. In this respect, I have been personally disappointed by his book. Honestly, I do not see the value of Part 2. Nevertheless, on the positive side, some of his ideas on future outlook, elaborated in Part 3, are worth reading and considering.

  Very long winded and not to the point. He draws from eclectic sources with disregard for their original meaning. He shows an utter lack of understanding of science and frequently misinterprets findings... or worse exaggerates those that fit his hypothesis beyond true meaning. This is an exercise in sophistry by a man who claims that all thought is but an algorithm. I'm my marginalia, I write delusional because that is what he claims human thought is. It is apt for this book. Don't buy it, don't get fooled by the title, read this brief review and say ""I'm not buying a book of this ilk!"". Bottom line he believes that only the few rich will evolve into machine enhanced superhuman and the rest will become irrelevant.. Nice vison of the future, huh.

  After many years of watching and pondering the glacial movement of society toward what I hoped would be a better place. I see how in one company called Amazon the use of AI has enabled it to know my needs almost better than me. It recommended this book for my pleasure and so it was. The company has also been a great positive in saving money and more importantly in saving time as I shopped for the products of daily life. This is merely one company of the many I use almost daily. The algorithms the author speaks of are incarnate through them. The author has crystallized my thoughts in his book and I am thankful. Some fear the coming of AI but it is here and already working for you in the guise of the new Gods called Amazon, Google, Netflix and Apple.

  For open minds, this book is a gift. Regardless of one's biases, if one wants to learn and have one's thoughts provoked by being stretched and pried open even wider, Harari's book is a treasure. He wants to engage in the conversation about the future, and yes, does want you to know what he thinks, but he puts it out there for you to pick over as you wish. A lot of what he says has the ring of truth, though that is a phrase he wouldn't use, truth being a troublesome word these days - and in the future. The best thing about the book is his clarity, his desire to be comprehensive in his embrace not just of humans but of all created things. Enjoy the book.

  Audience: Readers looking ahead to the future and wondering what the world may look like in 100 years. People interested in all aspects of humanity and the science, psychology, technology and politics behind everything we have done, are doing and will do in the future.Summed up in a few words: Relevant. Unbiased. Necessary.First Impression: Homo Deus was a book I was really excited to read! The tagline ' A brief history of tomorrow' really intrigued me as I don't really put much thought into my life life years down the line. This book is a must read! Not only does Harari talk about the future, he does so in such a wide spectrum of elements and details that I was impressed by how much information I took in. It also helps that he kept the language to an accessible and easy to read level, though there is technicality in some of the areas of the text. When I finished the book I was stuck between two very distinct and conflicting thoughts, the first was that I am comfortable with the steps that we as humans are taking to secure our futures and the other is that I am massively concerned about our future.Book Summary/ReviewHomo Deus: A Brief History Of Tomorrow is one of many groundbreaking books that are coming out this year that will influence certain non-fiction titles for the next decade or so. I have many of these books on my to-read list but I started with Homo Deus as it seem like a book that would cover all the bases and show me what we as humans are doing to secure our futures on earth and how we plan to do so. Yuval Noah Harari definitely achieves this, though it took a long time to get to sections I really wanted to read.Homo Deus started off strong, outlining what we have achieved up until today and where we may take life in the future. It did this from many different perspectives from agriculture, technology, economy, geography and medicine to psychology, politics, sociology, existentialism and science and it was incredibly interesting.Unfortunately for some who already have read a lot of books about human history, Harari does typical 'to see where we are going we must go back to the start' section which for me was slightly irritating but if you know very little about our past, our struggles and how we came to be then you will be very pleased with this section. I know that sounds like a complaint but it is really just a warning, because though it has been covered many times before, I felt that Harari did a great job with this section.The next section of the book covers how we brought the world to be in the last 2 or 3 centuries and again it has been done before, but Harari has such depth, understanding and control of the subject that I was left thoroughly informed and prepared for the last section, the one I had been waiting for, where are we going!I was massively impressed with this section, it both made me excited about the future, what technologies, scientific discoveries and biological/medicinal advances we may create or discover. It also scared the hell out of me too, where societies may change, how our life may become automated and where religion may evolve.I am not sure whether I enjoyed the subject or the author the most when reading this book. I feel that it is the subject overall as it is uncharted territory for me so to speak, I know I read a lot of science fiction but I have never read a book where someone has sat down and outlined all aspects of our actual humanity and extrapolated them into a realistic vision of our future, please let me know if you have read anything like this before.In terms of content, it is overwhelming, Harari must do nothing but research as he knows more about humanity than I will ever know, but he is so down to earth and treats readers fairly, not bogging everything down in technicality and jargon but bringing the subject down to a comprehensible and comfortable level. This meant I could read this book without having to look up every other word and pretend I understanding what he is saying instead of actually understanding what he is saying.If you want to know what we went through to get to this point, the famine, the war, the disease and hunger. If you want to know what life truly looks like today with social media, algorithms, happiness, religion and art. And if you want a vivid depiction of what are future may or may not become then Homo Deus is the book you want. I was most impressed with how Harari was so unbiased, he treated each viewpoint and opinion with respect and lets the reader make their own mind up of what to make of each scenario. Also there are great stories and case studies to back up his points as well as images to give the insights some context or texture.Fortunately this is not an 'all is lost' viewpoint on the future of human existence but it is definitely not all peachy and full of promise. Read the book, see what you think and tell me what you thought on Harari's approach to this topic. I found Homo Deus engaging, thought provoking, extremely concerning and delightfully promising as well.

  This is a rather long, but interesting historical read of the past and a look into a possible future. The author deals with 'big chunks' of history and attempts to give trends... some creative reading and definitely insightful and interesting. He also looks into the future... where all of us will be going - or at least those who live in developed countries - and even there, those who can afford it.The author has no inclusion of spirituality or religions, except to say their time has past.  I don't think he can prove that, but it's his read.Worth just reading for new ideas and trends.

  I’m not giving this one star because I actually want people to read this review. Classic Sophomore piece of work, Yuval basically rehashes a bunch of anecdotes and arguments that got cut out of Sapiens while standing on his soapbox of political views. The funny thing is I’m aligned with his perception of the world, but I’m on page 206 and am yet to see Yuval bring forward anything new that wasn’t in Sapiens except for his absolute disdain for religion (and I don’t claim to be at all religious). Overall, it’s a classic follow up to an idea and study that took Yuval his entire life to hone and then the publishers wanted round 2 and this book is not worth it. Overall summary (at least to page 206): religion sucks, humanity and consciousness is confusing and currently has no answers.

  Have the life sciences concluded that living organisms are algorithms? They have if you are a devotee of Dataism and cherry-pick your sources. Harari presents his recent book as a set of speculations for us to think about — all well and good, but in the process of speculating he sometimes sneaks in misleading generalizations and ""exaggerations"" (like the one above) as facts. I enjoyed Sapiens in spite of this, but Homo Deus made me wish that the author was more thorough in citing his sources and more candid when he claims consensus. Two and a half stars.

  Mr. Harari does an excellent job of stirring thoughts and sometimes emotions. I plan a second read, fo this ideas and conjectures, opinions, are amazing. I like the ending of the book, the message I interpret is that you and I can affect positive world change. One other thought I had: The Internet of Things is a grouping of tools to help humans handle the challenges of life. Let’s hope that those tools are used for positive ends, that those that use those tools with negative, destructive motives will be held in check. World societies, peoples, can work together. Let’s do it, work the process of learning to make the world a better place; collaborate.

  I enjoyed Homo Sapiens and this book as well. What appeals to me is the way Harari thinks and ties various concepts and events together. He makes history very interesting! And his perspective encourages me to think about current events in a different way. I bought his latest 21 Lessons for the 21st Century and am reading it through right now. The fact that I bought all three books is indicative of the esteem I hold this thinker.  I'm nobody important, but being able to engage with the mind of someone who thinks so out-of-the-box is a privilege!

  I enjoy his books and ideas, I am fan. Really like the chapter on humanism, but I think religion as the variant that uses a supernatural god is still well alive, this is so because we have not answered one of the most important questions: where do we come from, or for that matter where did everything *really and convincingly * come from. We may be able to live forever and create machines that superceed us in intelligence, but we are far from answering one of the most important questions, where do we come from, and until we do, god is alive in my opinion.On the technology side (I am an Engineer), I think He tends to be very optimistic, the creation of technological and scientific breakthroughs come with a very steep human effort, bordering, if not actual, slavery, it's easy to just see the surface, but have you tried to write code?, even in the 21st century ?, or create algorithms, or hardware ?, I am speaking for all men and women of science and engineering when I tell you: It is not easy!, and sometimes the book makes it sound as if it is a snap of the fingers, so, the last part is very optimistic on the technology side, we are far from all those dreams I think. Algorithms and machines don't create themselves, they are created by us, humans, and need to be maintained as well, they get corrupted, sick, virulent, attacked, as if alive, machines are not eternal, they get obsolete, they break, the future He portraits seems far ahead, but certainly the economy will evolve to adapt to the new machines yes, as it has been happening for quite some time, nothing new there. Good book, makes you think and wonder about the past and the future.

  Harari is an incredibly fresh and interesting thinker and writer. This book is about how our current species (homo sapiens, or ""wise man"") is evolving into the next (homo deus, or ""god man""). Of course the book is speculative in nature, but it does a good job of looking at several different trends in how society and people are changing, and where these trends might lead to. If you are looking for new and interesting ways of seeing the world, you would be hard-pressed to do better than Harari.

  A good read. A highlight of both this book and the previous entry, “Sapiens” is of course the feel and texture of the full colored paper. I’d imagine this raises the price a bit, but it greatly enhances the reading experience IMO! (Keep it away from ANY liquids however. Even a sweaty hand is like to make the ink run!)While I personally enjoyed Sapiens more, I did have a fun time reading this book as well.If you haven’t read Sapiens, I’d recommend you read that first as it’s a much more engaging book in my opinion simply on the fact that it’s not nearly as theoretical as this one. If you enjoyed Sapiens, specifically the final 1/3 of it, then you’d know what to expect from this book as it’s mainly an expansion on those last few chapters.While not perfect (it can feel like a bit of a slog to get through some parts, quite honestly), for a casual reader like myself it was certainly worth the time, as it did bring up some provoking thoughts.

  Are human beings merely algorithms which have yet to be engineered? That is the question that we, and the human machines that will dictate our future, have begun to answer. Unlike SAPIENS, where I found myself overwhelmed by Mr. Harari's brilliant, magisterial certainty, HOMO DEUS fully engages the reader in the hunt for the future. Thus, after he turns over the soil for us, we are free to grow our own thoughts. For example, what will humans be doing once we have highly intelligent, non-conscious algorithms that can do almost everything better? A haunting question, to be sure.We are about to become a sub-species. And while we are still human, we are also predictable algorithms. Which means a governmental computer may know you a lot better than you know yourself. That, like everything else Mr. Harari presents, is well worth thinking about. His books are a joy for those who love tho think.

  After reading Harari's book ""Sapiens - A brief history of humankind"". this book was a real let down.  It is dense and at places plodding. It could be a laborious effort to read this book. If you haven't read Sapiens, go invest your time and money in that book first before jumping in to Homo Deus.Harari seem to be far more interested in extending human lives beyond 100 years and also super charging the brains. I wish he had put a counter argument that majority of  people just want to live a normal life span but with intact health and brain. It is only a tiny minority that want to live for ever! So most of the book is focused on this tiny minority of human race.

  This book was a great read and presents a review of history with a view of basic human nature and produces a compelling view of the future in the growing scientific and biologic revolution that we are undergoing. The one question that presents itself to me is what purpose remains to drive a society which is based on the input of biologic units when the biologic units cease to have pertinent experience. It would seem to me that that without consciousness that the system has no additional input and would itself cease to exist. Thus the truly unconscious intelligence scenario might occur but would die for lack of input, I.e.,food. The scenario of enhanced humans would be the more likely outcome but even there purpose is missing. There would simply be no reason for such a society to exist since there would be no data to process

  This is probably my first review on Amazon. The world is changing in such a humanly incomprehensible speed that humans are becoming obsolete by the second. This book reads both as history, prophecy, and warning.Having bought the audiobook first was a good decision for me because I heard it as a student would have heard a professor. It is dense material and it is not relaxed reading by any means. I later bought the print version since I wanted to highlight some passages.  The book raises more questions than it answers, but the questions are the essential ones we should ask regarding the survival of the human race.

  Definitely one of the most important books I have ever read. It brings together so many threads and ideas - from philosophy, religions, psychology, neurology, artificial intelligence, natural sciences - to propose a very compelling narrative on how the human society and individual's condition might change as technological development will continue its evolution. In clearing the path for the envisaged future, the author busts enduring myths of traditional religions and exposes contradictions in the basic postulates of humanism, the modern religion. You may agree or not with his conclusions but it is certain that the big questions will remain with you.A very pleasant reading too, academic but perfectly accessible.

  His possible futures are all either without humanity or with a small cadre of ""improved"" humans. His dire assessment of religion is depressing. Maybe he is trying to scare us so much in order to motivate us to go a different direction. I think our creations and inspirations are more than algorithms that can be duplicated and surpassed by AI. It is interesting to read wide!y, but I do not agree with many of his conclusions. He leaves out too many factors to be taken very seriously. If he turns out to be correct, it is a terrible end for humanity, for you and for me.

  Harari considers organisms to be biochemical algorithms, and humans to be the most highly  evolved of them. Electronic algorithms are capable of processing humungous amounts of data that are far superior to the most complex biochemical algorithm and even and incomprehensible to humans. With further exponential increase in data proliferation and further advances in complex electronic algorithms in the future, Harari postulates how society, politics, our lives and even our belief systems might change in the future.

  I was captivated by this exceptionally well researched work on what got us here, and the realistic scenarios of where we will likely go from here.  At the same time enlightening and frightening, Homo Deus demands the reader to reflect on our current approach to engaging each other and the digital universe we find ourselves in.  The book is long and at times difficult to get through in terms of the depth of research the author uses to validate his thesis.  But I recommend pushing through it as it builds appropriately and believably to his conclusions.I will next go back to his first novel, Sapiens, to dig deeper into the author's theories.

  The way this book is packaged is somewhat misleading. It mainly is a work of philosophy written by a historian, covering many familiar philosophical issues...freewill, the physical basis of consciousness, the existence of God and the soul, human nature, and of course, philosophy of technology. It is a good expression of a secular worldview by an academic (albeit not an academic philosopher). Notably, the thinking is often driven by historical data, which makes it more compelling than, say, some of the philosophizing by Hitchens or Harris. But as a rule, I wouldn't recommend the book to academic philosophers. Yet it is a compelling ""snapshot"" of an academic, secular worldview from the early 21st century. I can thus see it being a useful touchstone for how today's intellectuals (vague) see their world.

  A fun read continuing from Sapiens.  Would have liked more time spent at the end on data-ism, it started to get a bit thin for me.  Lots of good questions raised, many which don't have answers - though sometimes could have used more time spent on potential answers (some things felt like only the question was asked and no attempt to provide possible answers).

  His explanation of our narrative/confabulatory/story voice (monkey mind) and our experiential voice (pure perception) combined with the lag between a thought and the hearing of “your” thought finally gave me a handle on Non-self. Thank you Professor.Such an amazing trilogy. What is there left to read after this amazingly lucid historical synthesis of that flawed animal, Homo Sapiens?

  Harari's first book, Sapiens, A Brief History of Humankind, is absolutely excellent.  Harari write clearly, in an interesting way and with a sense of humor.  Homo Deus, the followup of Sapiens, is an equally fine read!  I would highly recommend both these books.  They may cause you to think a bit differently of our world.

  This book is a follow up to the first book ""Sapiens"" so I encourage people to read that first. Comparing the two I liked sapiens better but this book is still a quality read. While you should always remain skeptical about future predictions I think Harari gives lots of possibilities and leaves much of the deeper thought for the reader. I think some information in the book is reiterated from sapiens but If you liked Sapiens you should read this next

  Harari hits another home run. I love the subtitle of this book, A Brief History of Tomorrow. And Harari builds a solid case for his views of how the world of technology might blend with or destroy Homo Sapiens. His book is broken into three parts and takes us through human history (much more detail in Harari’s book Sapiens: A brief history of humankind), how we add meaning to the world and then how we lose control.Premise: The New Human AgendaIn Chapter 1, Harari suggests that there is an entirely new agenda for human beings. What will we strive for? We have never settled for our achievements but rather we crave for more, better, faster, different.“And having raised humanity above the beastly level of survival struggles, we will now aim to upgrade humans into gods, and turn Homo sapiens into Homo deus.”—Harari, Yuval Noah. Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow (p. 21). HarperCollins. Kindle Edition.The hypothesis is that we will not be satisfied to do any less than continue down the path that technology and so-called Artificial Intelligence is paving for us.Part I: Homo Sapiens Conquers the WorldIn Chapters 2 & 3, Harari takes us through a brief history of the Anthropocene period and how the human “spark” ignited the creation of a totally new world. He asks three provocative questions, and then goes about answering them:What is the difference between humans and all other animals?How did our species conquer the world?Is Homo sapiens a superior life form, or just the local bully?From these questions and Harari’s astute observations, we learn that no matter what we think, we humans will shape our world and create a religion to follow. What will the next religion be?Part II: Homo Sapiens Gives Meaning to the WorldAgain, three questions set up this section of the book:What kind of world did humans create?How did humans become convinced that they not only control the world, but also give it meaning?How did humanism – the worship of humankind – become the most important religion of all?In Chapters 4 through 7 Harari takes us through the history of how humans created meaning for themselves through a framework of beliefs we call religion. From the storytellers to the Humanist revolution, we see how Homo sapiens wrestle with nature and human nature for control and destiny.“Yet in fact modernity is a surprisingly simple deal. The entire contract can be summarised in a single phrase: humans agree to give up meaning in exchange for power.” (p. 199)Part III: Homo Sapiens Loses ControlUp until this section, Harari spent most of his time discussing how we got to where we find ourselves today. And now we find several hypotheses or scenarios for the future. And as usual, three questions:Can humans go on running the world and giving it meaning?How do biotechnology and artificial intelligence threaten humanism?Who might inherit humankind, and what new religion might replace humanism?Chapters 8 through 11 takes us on a journey from the time bomb in the laboratory (no free will) to the new Data Religion.“For example, when a neuron fires an electric charge, this may be either a deterministic reaction to external stimuli, or perhaps the outcome of a random event such as the spontaneous decomposition of a radioactive atom. Neither option leaves any room for free will. Decisions reached through a chain reaction of biochemical events, each determined by a previous event, are certainly not free. Decisions resulting from random subatomic accidents aren’t free either; they are just random. And when random accidents combine with deterministic processes, we get probabilistic outcomes, but this too doesn’t amount to freedom.” (pp. 282-283)In other words, “Free will exists only in the imaginary stories we humans have invented.” This undermines the story we tell about our liberal philosophy and also undermines the concept of the individual.A scenario for the future is that we humans will become gods in our own minds—for a while at least. Harari suggests that, “Since intelligence is decoupling from consciousness, and since non-conscious intelligence is developing at breakneck speed, humans must actively upgrade their minds if they want to stay in the game.” He calls this new religion “Techno-humanism.”DataismIn Chapter 11, Harari introduces Dataism.Dataism declares that the universe consists of data flows, and the value of any phenomenon or entity is determined by its contribution to data processing. This may strike you as some eccentric fringe notion, but in fact it has already conquered most of the scientific establishment. (p. 367)Dataism declares that organisms are algorithms. And, Harari states, that this is the current scientific dogma. He goes on to say that, “If humankind is indeed a single data-processing system, what is its output? Dataists would say that its output will be the creation of a new and even more efficient data-processing system, called the Internet-of-All-Things. Once this mission is accomplished, Homo sapiens will vanish.”Read This Book!No short review can do this book justice. It is my opinion that we all need to be thinking deeply about this topic. Where are we humans taking our species? How will we find meaning in the future? I leave you with one last quotation from the book:“Sapiens evolved in the African savannah tens of thousands of years ago, and their algorithms are just not built to handle twenty-first-century data flows. We might try to upgrade the human data-processing system, but this may not be enough. The Internet-of-All-Things may soon create such huge and rapid data flows that even upgraded human algorithms would not be able to handle them. When cars replaced horse-drawn carriages, we didn’t upgrade the horses – we retired them. Perhaps it is time to do the same with Homo sapiens.”—Harari, Yuval Noah. Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow (p. 388). HarperCollins. Kindle Edition.I hope you will get the book and make time to give it a thoughtful reading.

  ""Homo Deus"" by Harari is a brilliant and creative must read for anyone concerned with the history and future of our species.  This is broad based analysis and speculation based on the hard sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences.  It is well written, easily read, and well worth the effort. This is truly an exciting and inspired work.  I recommend it highly, along with Harari's other major work, ""Sapiens,""  equally worthy of a five star recommendation. John W Greco, M.S.

  A book you should read but also one that will drive you crazy. The author addresses numerous points in a straightforward way and brings up things worth considering and debating, but does so in an uneven way.It would be great as a book club book or for a philosophy course, but reading it in isolation could make you confused, inspired, or despairing, or even a combination of all three.The first portion of the book, dealing with animal welfare and industrial farming, was particularly unpleasant, but after that the content wasn't difficult to digest.

  It's interesting that this book, which asks the reader to consider the question, ""what's more important, intelligence or consciousness?"", never once uses the word ""materialism"" (if I am not mistaken).  I hope he explores all of the layers of his question in his next book.  I suspect that his exploration of this question will be far more interesting than the tired stuff we get from Shermer, Dawkins, singularity propeller heads, etc.  Professor Harari's humility suffuses his writing, and I find it refreshing.  I actually care about this gentleman's opinion.

  This book does not fulfill the promise of scoping out the potential futures for humanity. The arguments fall flat and claims seem absurd.

  A good read that made me think. However, the possible projections ""within the next 20 years"" (a common estimate) are overly optimistic. Technology is nowhere near many of the things Yuval envisions and humanity may simply opt to not do many of these things due to moral concerns or regulations.

He called my attention to Lewis' view of what makes us Human, our descent into Nature, the influence of Science and the coming Controllers. Wow, and published in 1947!Now on to Sapiens. I hope reading Homo Deus first hasn't weakened the impact of its acclaimed predecessor.

Harari is a fascinating thinker who brings his broad knowledge to bear on great issues.  Harari demolishes organized religion and free will, so if you are sensitive to those issues, be forewarned!

  In a world clearly hurtling faster and faster towards more and more capable AI this stands as one of the best contemplations of the consequences. Well worth the read.

Is it a phenomenon emergent from a subset of innate intelligences, an awareness of self against a dynamic background of ‘otherness’, or something else entirely?

  Great insight about human past and possible futures. Most of the history events were carefully selected to realise how we would probably react to similar situations happening in the near future. Nevertheless, may be some of the scientific and technological predictions are overstated, such as gene manipulation that is really far from superhuman production, indeed the algorithms in the process where you put some DNA and then obtain a living organism is completely unknown yet, but the general idea about how AI algorithms are getting bigger that our understanding is actually happen.If you enjoyed the author's prievous book Sapiens, you most likely will enjoy this book.

  I bought this book because I so enjoyed Yuval's previous book, Homo Sapiens. Homo Deus looks forward from the present time, where Sapiens looked back to the origins of Homo Sapiens. Of course, looking forwards can only be conjecture but oh - how convincing is each scenario that Yuval suggests as a possible future development! Whether Capitalist, Communist or Liberal you will find a future you can anticipate with complacency - or the reverse! The future discussed seriously but with a light touch.

  Harari's book Sapiens was so good I had to try Homo Deus when it came out.

  Not as good as Homo Sapiens so went below expectations. Personally I believe consciousness is prerequisite for intelligence so in that sense machines or AI is not smarter than us, they just have better processing capability. I also disagree with Data being the most important thing going forward. A lot of data is garbage and what is good data is still not reliable enough to predict how human mind works and is unlikely to change going forward.

  The book starts off great - lots to think about. For example, one might think of human enhancement as being in the realm of moral choices. But, as history shows, technology and consumerism/capitalism has an inexorable march towards giving people what they want. Choice may not come into the equation. He does a good job at keeping the content accessible. I was most let down by the last couple chapters - they are highly speculative and I think less founded. But overall it provides a lot of material to think about, material that is important because we are at a point in history where things are happening at a rapid pace.

  This is a very interesting book written by Yuval Noah Harari.  It takes on a viewpoint on the future of the human race that is quite different than that of many other authors.  It is well researched and seems to make a lot of sense.  While it is very interesting it may shock some people a little bit thinking about the terrible potential that we as human beings have to cause disasters in this world.  Some of Harari's ideas may be seen as disturbing but none of them are so unreasonable that they can be discarded without much consideration.  Overall, Homo Deus is a very thought-provoking book written by a very talented author.  Highly recommended.

  21 Lessons for the 21st century is not comparable to Harari’s previous landmark works of history and prognostication Sapiens and Homo Deus.  Written with the purpose of focusing not on the future nor the past but on contemporary civilization, Harari tends to make sweeping assumptions and badly reasoned arguments when he is not flat out contradictory.  Even worse, most of the content is the sort of generalizations seen in futurist websites and Facebook groups.  It’s not so much that it’s false as that it’s not new.I will try to summarize some examples of why I think this book is a poor relative to Harari’s previous works.  Harari argues that elections might be infeasible in the future. Why?  Because if elections were about reason then obviously we would appoint a committee of experts to choose our leaders. Since we don’t, elections must be all about emotions which, as seen in 2016, are increasingly going to be controlled by AI.  Therefore, per Harari, elections will become passé.  He does not consider that, like guessing the number of coins in a jar, elections might be held because, when you combine millions of voters responses, individual biases in reasoning will balance each other out and you will arrive at the best answer.Another example: AI will soon create works of art superior to humans.  This is because Harari asserts that art is all about the emotions and so AI will be able to manipulate these emotions better than a human artist.  However, when I, for one, read Aeschylus I don’t experience much emotion but do enjoy the incredible craftsmanship and artistry of a creative genius.  Many patrons of the arts I think would agree.Lastly, the book concludes with Harari explaining that all meta-narratives—Christian, liberal, communist, Islamic, etc.— have been proven wrong by modern science. Even the stories of personal identity we tell ourselves—what we were like as children and how that made us into the adults we are today—are bogus because there’s no human soul that would make different times in our life into a unity.So, having dismissed all personal narratives, Harari then goes on to tell his own story about how Buddhist meditation led him from being a confused and stressed teenager into the confident author of Sapiens and Homo Deus.  Doesn’t Harari see that he cannot recommend mindfulness meditation as the correct response to personal suffering by telling a story if several pages earlier he said that personal narratives are illusory?Harari is a talented writer and one can enjoy reading this book as an intelligent man’s musings about the contemporary world picture.  But it simply cannot be considered in the same light as his previous monumental achievements.

  Yuval Noah Harari’s name came up when a few years ago a friend urged me to read Harari’s best-selling Sapiens, which I have put off, but since reading 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, a book that reads more like an essay collection, than a outright book (not a bad thing in this case), I do want to feast on all of Harrari’s books. I had to underline close to a hundred cogent insights throughout the book.If anything unifies these essays--ranging from religion, morality, AI, terrorism, universal basic income, freedom, equality, meditation, nationalism, post-truth fascism, Trumpism, justice, secularism, and education—it is Harari’s desire to use his expertise as a historian, and by turn, a futurist, to equip us with the tools, attitudes, and moral approaches to moving forward in the 21st Century, shedding unwanted baggage such as fundamentalism, nationalism, racism, and other “isms.”In his Introduction, he brilliantly begins: “In a world deluged by irrelevant information, clarity is power. . . . As a historian, I cannot give people food or clothes—but I can try to offer some clarity, thereby helping to level the global playing field.”He warns us that the liberal secular vision of humankind moving forward with the powers of reason has taken a huge hit with the nihilism of Trumpism.Taken as a whole, Harari’s book is intended to give us the tools to ward off nihilism, arrogance, and primitive “isms” and to become a fully realized modern human being. Highly recommended.

  What a letdown!Ok... I Loved Yuval Noah Harari's books ""Sapiens"" and ""Homo Deus"" so when I saw he had a new one out, I jumped at it. Am not even halfway through but don't think it's even worthy of finishing. It is an exceedingly poorly thought out polemic. I dont mind having my opinions challenged but on any issue I had disagreement stark or nuance, I felt my position misrepresented. He assumes the mindset and beliefs of any group not in line with his often shallow and boringly common in a cartoonish and denigrating simplicity.It's like his agent said ""Yuval baby, you're on fire! We need another book stat to ride this wave!""Yuval: ""But I have nothing ready, I'm kinda sifting through ideas and...""Agent: ""Blah, blah, blah, listen they love you, you're a star! Write anything! Don't be shy! Now I'm gonna lock you in that room and you're not getting out till you hand me 400 pages!""Yuval: ""But on what!?""Agent: ""I don't care! Now get in there!""Having covered the past in Sapiens and the future in Homo Deus, he must have shrugged his shoulders and thought ""OK then, the present. But I'm kinda hungry so let's get this over with...""At which point he went into the room and just channeled the most pedestrian, uncurious shallow, black hat/white hat leftist stream of conciousness drivel imaginable. Expecting to be wowed I was shocked at how many times in the first few hours I was prompted to say out loud ""False dichotomy"". Equally shocked that in the first half hour, Naseem Taleb's (Of Black Swan fame) phrase IYI ... Intellectual yet idiot, came to mind. It reminds me of a great 60's bands crappy 3rd album that was trash because by then they had exhausted their best ideas and were deep into the ""Behind the music"" hard core drug addiction, alcoholism and infighting. I pictured even the lamest professor with a passing aquaintance with critical thinking taking a red correcting pen to the pages and running out of ink halfway through. Full of more straw men than a drunk sees when watching the video wall at Best Buy with 30 screens all showing The Wizard of Oz, and so much self contradiction one can only guess the agent bribed the editor to not bother reading it before rushing it to print.. sheesh.Felt like seeing the curtain pulled back on the Wizard of Oz.

  How safe from obsolescence is the job you have now? Do you have the skills to adapt in the rapidly changing Big Data environment? How will the merger of infotech and biotech affect our collective future? How can we prevent climate change from irrevocably changing the planet? What will the next global armed conflict look like? Is the recent rise in nationalism a threat to world security? How does “post-truth” (i.e., fake news) affect our thinking? Do terrorist attacks create more fear and suffering than they should? How do the stories we tell ourselves, whether religious or secular in nature, influence our behavior?These are all questions that are clearly of concern to each of us in the here and now. They also motivate many of the “lessons” discussed in 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, a volume that once again combines Yuval Noah Harari’s unique blend of history, science, philosophy, and anthropology. Unlike Sapiens, which explored mankind’s past 10,000 years, and Homo Deus, which projects humanity’s long-term future, this book purports to assess the major issues facing us in the present. Unfortunately, this exploration is neither wholly successful nor is it nearly as compelling as the author’s previous two efforts.To be sure, there is a lot to like about what appears here. In particular, Harari’s discussion of the economic, legal, and social challenges created by the ascent of Big Data is very illuminating. Who owns the information summarizing our lives—or, perhaps more critically, who controls it—is indeed likely to be one of the major issues defining our near-term future. I also thought that the author’s interpretations of nationalism and secularism were insightful. Overall, he did a nice job of connecting several disparate themes into a cohesive bigger picture (e.g., a discussion of the importance of developing a global community is followed by an examination of nationalist sentiment which leads to a consideration of the immigration problem and then to the threat posed by terrorism).The main problem I had with all of this is that major portions of the book were not especially original and often seemed like slightly reworked versions of arguments used in the author’s previous studies. For instance, the rise of biotech was thoroughly covered in Homo Deus and humankind’s use of rituals and ability to create useful fictions were essential parts of Sapiens. As such, there are really far fewer than 21 distinct lessons presented here, despite the volume containing 21 different chapters. Finally, the last two chapters involving the role of personal stories and the importance of meditation were woefully self-indulgent and had an off-putting pop-psychology/self-help feel to them. So, while 21 Lessons for the 21st Century is not at all a bad book, the reader might be better served by considering the author’s earlier work instead.

  Harari’s first two books, ‘Sapiens’, ‘and ‘Homo Deus’ have been critically acclaimed, and one wonders what else can he come up with. This question is normally asked of fiction writers, but Harari’s first two books have been so tremendously popular to the extent that they were likened to best-selling novels. This, his third book, does not disappoint. It is a book of 21 essays on different subjects beginning with ‘Disillusionment’, ‘Work’, ‘Liberty’, and ‘Equality’ under Part I, entitled, ‘The Technological Challenge’. The book has a total of five Parts. The other four are: ‘The Political Challenge’, Despair and Hope’, Truth’, and ‘Resilience’. Harari’s thoughts spring from the basic, but important question, ‘What can we say about the meaning of life today?’ In order to put the age-old question into the context of today, Harari examines the scientific and cultural changes that have transformed human societies across the world. One major change wrought by technology is the phenomenon in which we get increasingly distanced from our own bodies, and are being absorbed into smartphones and computers. Harari shows how ‘benign patriotism’ can so easily be transformed into ultra-nationalism; form the belief that ‘My nation is unique’ (every nation is) to ‘My nation is supreme’. Once we get to that, war and strife is, frighteningly, just a step away. He devotes a chapter each to ‘immigration’ and ‘terrorism’ because these are the two bogeymen of the world – not just the Western world. Harari fears that when New York or London eventually sinks below the Atlantic Ocean, people will be blaming Bush, Blair and Obama for focussing on the wrong front. Given the undertones of religious conflicts and differences in the wars that an American-led West had inflicted on various parts of the world, Harari had much to say in his chapters on ‘God’ and ‘Secularism’. He tries to show how irrational belief in a personal God is. ‘Science cannot explain the “Big Bang”, they exclaim, “so that must be God’s doing”…After giving the name of “God” to the unknown secrets of the cosmos, they then use this to somehow condemn bikinis and divorces’. Not to mention abortion, eating pork, and drinking beer. What does it mean ‘Not to use the name of God in vain’? Harari suggests that it should mean that ‘we should never use the name of God to justify our political interests, our economic ambitions or our personal hatred’. He exposes the problems of dogmatism, and warns against the illusion that the falsity in one’s creed or ideology will never be allowed to happen. ‘if you believe in an absolute truth revealed in a transcendent power’, he writes, ‘you cannot allow yourself to admit any error – for that would nullify your whole story. But if you believe in a quest for truth by fallible humans, admitting blunders is an inherent part of the game’. Harari’s conclusion is a treat to read and has much to commend in the way he reconciles religious beliefs and rational thinking. Humans love story-telling, he writes, and the answers to the question, ‘what is the meaning of life?’ lie in the stories – but we do not have just one story each. And this is crucial. We not just a Muslim, or an Italian, or a capitalist. We do not have just one identity as a human. And we have many stories. We must not shut them out for the sake of one favourite.

  Just because a gifted historian have published a very good book (Sapiens) about the past, it is naive to expect him to write anything coherent or remotely meaningful about future. This book is full of very common fluff you can read in hundreds of websites, newsletters and magazines. I was hoping for some insight the author so brilliantly offered to the Sapiens readers, but that would need at least a rudimentary understanding of technology and economics.  Pity.

  Mr. Harari is brilliant at delineating our distant history but his future extrapolations don't seem as well informed. Here are some of his ideas:1. A cell phone will one day perform the function of a doctor to people in developing countries.Uh... how exactly? By providing information and receiving data, you mean? Like it does NOW. And how exactly will a phone produce and administer medicine?2. 3-D printers will make garment workers superfluous. You will get a code, go to a printing center and they will give you your t-shirt.Again, you can print a t-shirt NOW. That does not mean you will be able to print out jeans, cashmere sweaters and Nike sneakers any time soon - or ever.3. All menial/working class jobs will be replaced by machinery.This is not exactly a new concept.4. Most things exist only in our collective imagination. Every single entity, all companies only exist in our minds - because the company Peugeot has an interesting history.This is from 'Sapiens' but mentioned here to illustrate a point: Another whacky extrapolation.There's a New Yorker article in here somewhere but '21 Lessons' lacks the impact of 'Sapiens' because it's not about our distant past - which the author is brilliant at - but our distant future, of which he is less than convincing.

  Harari's two previous books--Sapiens (which explored our past) and Homo Deus (which considered our potential future based on current developments)--are exceptional detailed looks at a wide range of topics. In 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, he breaks down these broader themes into digestible chapters that are practical, relevant, and compelling.Many of the ideas here are ones explored in his previous works, though I found reviewing them again helpful and reinforcing; they also allow new readers to understand his theories without having to work through his previous books (which interested readers should do anyway). In addition, he organizes these ideas into five broad themes--the technological challenge, the political challenge, despair and hope, truth, and resilience--and each chapter has both a title (e.g., ""Liberty"") and a core concept (e.g., ""Big Data is Watching You""). Harari often does a nice job tying one chapter into the next, making the entire work a cohesive argument instead of a series of unrelated musings.Harari writes from an authoritative position not because he earned a doctorate in history from Oxford, but because he's thoughtful, insightful, well-read, and relies on the scholarship of many others. He has the ability to construct powerful arguments through research, history, philosophers, cultural study, and his own insights and analysis, and he is quite willing to suggest flaws in the arguments of groups on both sides of any issue--religious, political, nationalistic, cultural, etc. But what I most appreciate about this is his repeated admonition that we don't know as much as we think we do. This allows him to take a ""guide on the side"" stance instead of being a ""sage on the stage,"" and the reader is therefore challenged to consider the arguments and find points of agreement or disagreement.So yes, there are areas where a reasonable person could disagree with Harari in terms of content and presentation. At one point he argues that since all experiences are self-created, ""Whatever you can feel in Fiji, you can feel anywhere in the world."" I believe some experiences are so unique to setting and context that they'll only occur in that specific setting (including not only Fiji, but seeing ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" on the big screen or attending a Bruce Springsteen concert). His section on ""Despair and Hope"" is heavy on despair and light (perhaps absent) of hope, and his section on Resilience focuses more on the challenges we face than how we may overcome them.In fact, Harari offers little in the way of ""solutions"" to the numerous problems he describes. Interestingly, his closing the book with Meditation suggests this is the closest thing he has to an answer, and in a sense this is correct; given his emphasis on awareness of our challenges, the practice of paying attention is critical. However, he describes meditation as a method to alleviate personal suffering by recognizing that all experiences are self-created because there's no objective truth, and the implication seems to be that alleviating suffering is thus a central goal. This doesn't mean we should focus on relieving the suffering of others, as he shares an anecdote of a person saying his purpose in life was to help others, but ""what I still haven't figured out is why the other people are here."" Does Harari believe that if everyone relieved personal suffering they'd be happy? Does it matter if there's no broader meaning to life in terms of our happiness, when lots of research indicates a sense of meaning and purpose is what makes us happiest? Is it a goal of life to be happy, or just to exist until we don't exist anymore? He might have answered this by simply explaining why he dedicated so much time to researching and writing this book (and his others). Understanding what motivated him to take on this task could have shared some insight into how he personally finds meaning and purpose in life,  which would have added some nice context to his outstanding work. Sadly, that's missing.

  The author consistently overestimates technical capabilities of AI systems and jumps to conclusions that are not backed with any hard science or facts. Extrapolating from existing big data systems and algorithm requires understanding the limitations of these systems and the author clearly does not have the requisite technical understanding.There are a few good parts like explaining the feedback loops that make humans into ""data cows"" but these good parts are too far apart to make the book worthwhile.

  This is the third book by the author that I have read. His Homo Sapiens was excellent. His Homo Deus was an utter disappointment. This third book is somewhere between the two.In addressing challenges we face in the 21st century, the author is often venting his feelings against entrenched dogma. He presents himself as a staunch advocate of science and truth. However, he is not immune from jumping to conclusions. For example, in referring to advances in the study of biochemical processes in the human body, he concludes that human desires are nothing more than biochemical processes.  And In asserting that the Christian bible is fiction (I am not Christian and have no interest in defending their bible), he says that there is no scientific proof that the serpent tempted Adam and Eve.  That comment may well be correct, but from a scientific point of view, the absence of proof says nothing about whether something is truth or fiction.When it comes to issues where historical knowledge is relevant, such as on war, terrorism, and internal relations, the author presents excellent insight.  However, when he ventures into biotech and AI, his comments tend to be superficial.The author raises important issues in his book, but his answers appear neither here or there.  Part of the book is very interesting, but his ideas may not always stand up to academic scrutiny, I am sorry to say.

  This book is hot. Recommendations of it and quotes from it are everywhere. I was very disappointed see it in its entirety, and I abandoned it about halfway through. I found it superficial and facile. There was nothing in it that I hadn’t already heard, and heard put better and in a deeper and more nuanced context. This is a self-help book written, as all such are, to address the moment’s anxieties in the most anodyne and superficial fashion. It is empty calories for the mind: the reader will feel satisfied and full, but really the mind will be neither nourished nor expanded. On the good side, the author does make some mordant if obvious observations. But again, naming an issues is only the barest beginning of understanding it.

  This book made my head heart.....in a good way. Right from the start I found myself highlighting, folding corners, and scribbling in the margins.While there were some chapters that were a bit above my insights in the topics, I found the book to be so thought provoking and engaging. Anyone who takes the risk to write on these topics will endure scrutiny for sure, but I love about books like this is that is forces me to pause and rethink my beliefs and ideals. Time and time again I wrote down a quote into my Evernote page and then conducted research to learn more.I loved the topics of AI, Education, Ignorance, Transportation, and Post Truth. Over and over again I came to realization that the paradoxal riddles and philosphical puzzles are quickly becoming realities that we will have to develop answers around.While none of know how the future will pan out, this book gives me thoughts about all sides that I never considered and further cemented the importance of my job as an educator to get the next generation as prepared as we possibly can.This book will be one I know I will return to time and time again as I learn new things and want to remember what shook my brain into new spaces.

  First off I highly recommend the physical book over the audio book. The framing of the sections and chapters is easily lost in audio book format and it loses important structure. The book probably works best read in succession with his earlier books but is also fine to read first. New readers will get lost in the beginning where there is a heavy dose of futurist speculation. That quickly passes and you can always go back and read Homo Deus later.My review of the content of the book itself is very similar to Harari's earlier work in Sapiens and Homo Deus. This book will make you think and it is worth reading for that reason alone. At the same time it feels incomplete due to leaving many hanging threads that are not explored. It repeats speculation over and over without justifying the reliance on it. And it misses important additional points for the topics it explores. It is not clear if they are intentionally ignored for simplification or glaring omissions.  The final issue for some readers will be that the book doesn't have many answers. If Homo Deus bummed you out this book will likely leave you depressed.I was not bummed out by Homo Deus though. This book left me with the same positive feeling. There are no easy answers and the future will require hard work. It is a call to action that provides tools to guide that action to where it can be most impactful. It tears down the mythical liberal democracy as an ethereal concept and leaves stable pillars to build off of. Nationalism is not suited to handle global problems. Democracy beat communism and autocracies due to superior information processing, but technology is allowing communism and autocracies to process information much more efficiently. Knowing ourselves is a critical step in the fight for a future that will likely get scarier before we get through it. We need more trust, humility and a lot more cross-discipline cohesion to make a world without a true objective truth work.

  I thought I was going to read evidence-based “fact book.” But instead, it was mostly a collection of the author’s opinions and observations of the supposedly 21st century. I would say some of them qualify as wishful thinking. For example, AI will completely replace physicians and surgeons. Unfortunately, it is not that simple. It takes at least 7 years after college to make a primary care doctor, 8 years for OB/GYN, 9 years for general surgeon, 11 years for neuro surgeon. It takes more than just memorization and regurgitation of medicine to become a physician/surgeon. A bunch of codes built by non-physicians (i,e. software engineers) won’t make AI practice medicine. Those engineers can’t even get our EMRs straight. Oh, please. Although self driving cars are a great concept and that is probably more achieavble than other AI endeavours, I still cannot figure out how to code ‘instincts’ or ‘reflexes.’ By definition, reflexes bypass the cerebral cortex all together. What we can code is algorithm, which is what cortex is for. Until then, it will remain sci-fi for a while. We still do not have the flying skateboard that we saw from Back to the Future. We have not seen Doc’s car that can travel through time. Heck, we do not even have Kitt from Knight Rider. And I certainly hope we will never have Minority Report.

  Yuval Harari turns his attention to the present, and with it we see a wreck of what we thought we knew.  He tears apart nearly everything - democracy, capitalism, traditional religion, even the belief in the existence of our selves and our purpose.  I admit that I had hoped a synthesis would follow, a prescription for how to use his razor-sharp insights into the true human condition to act in the present to build a better future.  Instead, what the reader is left with are a handful of building tools that do not seem sufficient for the task.  That's in keeping with everything he wrote in Sapiens and Homo Deus:  human life is complex, the history emerging from it is vastly more complex, and our understanding of it is mostly through heuristics and metaphors.  The challenge before us is very hard:  take all this complexity, sift through it, and try to shape a future in which suffering is minimized while meaning for our lives is explored (although it may be there is none to find).  He doesn't have an answer, and neither do we, but with so many of our myths cleared away and the problems brought clearly into focus, there's a feeling of hope that it might be possible to find solutions.

  Sapiens was about the past.Homo Deus speculated about human nature and about the future we might build.21 Lessons mainly relies on Homo Deus' ideas to bring forward a discussion about today and the short-term future. The discussion is broken down in 21 chapters related to technological challenges, political challenges, ""despair and hope"" (religion, terrorism, war, etc.) , truth and resilience.The book shares the didactical approach that made the previous two so pleasurable to read.My 4 star review comes out two issues I have with it:a) I think the ""Lessons"" part of the title is a bit misleading. The book is more a collection of relevant thoughts for the next years, than a set of Lessons. It's eye opening, but there's no clear direction about what to do. I don't have a problem ""per se"" with this (quite frankly it's hard to think about what can be done regarding issues so complex and so global) but nonetheless the title does not seem to be rightb) Now, some months after I read it, I find it hard to remember a specific learning I got from it. This was not the case with Harari's previous two works.Still, I strongly recommend this book

  Sorry for the Simpsons reference - I could not resist.  I had great hopes for Yuval Noah Harari's 21 Lessons for the 21st Century - it was highly recommended to me as a thought provoking read. I began the book on a transatlantic flight and found it interesting but reading such a book in that environment is less than ideal. After resuming reading after I got home, I found myself having to reread earlier portions in a new light and found myself less than impressed.Harari's book is laid out in 21 chapters each composing of a major thought provoking theme such as work, liberty, fake news, etc.  The first chapter - Disillusionment is probably the single best section of the book. Harari highlights mankind's tendency to think in terms of stories and how competing stories - liberalism vs communism drove the 20th century. While liberalism won the 20th century, it faces a crisis of confidence in the 21st. Thought provoking and an interesting take on why the world seems to be in such disorder.Following the insightful first chapter - Harari quickly lays out the problems that the 21st century holds such as the rise of AI destroying jobs. He offers potential solutions that at first glance he appears to point out the pros/cons but the reader quickly realize he has his preferred solutions. That is where the book begins to disappoint. He solutions are almost exclusively anti-humanistic. It begins with the second chapter covering work where he highlights the rise of artificial intelligence (referred to as algorithms). It reaches a crescendo in the Chapter on Liberty - where he advocates replacing democracy with non-biased 'algorithms' to determine leaders  since humans can be hacked, are emotional, and can't objectively chose the best leaders. Harari seems to believe humanity is another machine that can be hacked and easily manipulated.The book looks down on religion and nationalism highlighting their worst aspects but recognizes they can be useful as a sort of opiate for the masses....as long as both religion and nationalism are a smokescreen for a sort of world civilization. Harari celebrates secularism as inherently superior to religion/God since his definition of secularism focuses on a search for truth tempered with compassion. He recognizes that some people would argue monsters such as monsters might be considered secular but dismisses that argument in that Stalin was dogmatic and anything but Harari's definition of being secular. He doesn't give religion the same benefit of the doubt.While I object to the central thesis of 21 Lesson for the 21st Century - it did make me think. In that the book served a useful purpose. This is a book with big ideas that has clearly received a wide audience among policy makers globally. In that aspect it is an important book since his arguments will be continued to be discussed.

  As long as he sticks to his expertise it's a fascinating read. His insights and analysis of historical, economic, anthropological and  political phenomena and evolution are really brilliant. When he delves into predictions for the future he hits his limits very quickly. Harari has a populist obsession with AI and biotech which is not backed by knowledge and sometimes borders on conspiracy theories of the tin-hat variety. The contrast is all the more obvious as I just finished reading ""Life after Google"" by George Gilder, someone who understands the evolution of technology very well.

  I loved Sapiens. Funny, clever, sharp, it managed to make you pause and think about very serious issues. Its main quality was the 30'000 feet perspective it brought on things and demonstrated that, when done well, hyper-simplification can be a very useful tool. Importantly the book did not taking itself too seriously and always felt tongue-in-cheek. In Homo Deus, Harari unfortunately takes himself far too seriously and ends up being both boring and often wrong, or at the very least questionable, in its analysis.21 Lessons is a bit of a mix between Sapiens and Homo Deus but with nothing new. So the bits that are related to Sapiens (history, religion, myths) can sometimes be brilliant and those bits related to Homo Deus (biotechnologies, artificial intelligence, etc) infuriating, but either way, never original. A book that did not deserve to be written.My suggestion is: read Sapiens if you have not yet, but don't bother with this one.

  Our dentist recommended Harari’s “Sapiens” to my wife, which she read and so taken continued through his second book “Homo Deus,” and went on to his “21 Lessons” which she commended to me. While I usually have my own reading agenda, I eventually got around to completing the book and glad I did as it clearly and succinctly outlines the major challenges of our times.While I do not agree with all of Harari’s characterizations or proposed solutions, I have to appreciate the directness and honesty in his delivery. Since his books are so popular and numerously reviewed, I only briefly refer to the content of Harari’s book and concentrate more on aspects that I found more or less useful.Within the book, Harari’s progresses through 5 parts to present his “21 Lessons.” In Part I, he conveys “The Technological Challenge” resulting from developments such as in life and computer sciences including (1) Disillusionment, (2) Work, (3) Equality, and (4) Liberty. Continuing in Part II, the author discusses “The Political Challenge” that ensues from these occurrences consisting of (5) Community, (6) Civilization, (7) Nationalism, (8) Religion, and (9) Immigration. Within Part III, Harari deals with the “Despair and Hope” resulting in society involving (10) Terrorism, (11) War, (12) Humility, (13) God, and (14) Secularism. For Part IV, the author wrestles with the difficulties in getting at the “Truth” entailed in (15) Ignorance, (16) Justice, (17) Post Truth, and (18) Science Fiction. Finally, in Part V, he takes up “Resilience” and ways to continue to function and advance with (19) Education, (20) Meaning, and (21) Meditation.Overall, I am impressed with Harari’s sweep as well as his ability as a historian to be a “disruptive thinker” and put important emerging issues into clear relief. His descriptions compare favorably with books such as Rutherford’s

   in expressing the complexity in these topics and their extensive ramifications. The author’s discussions also remind me of those contained in Brooke Gladstone’s 

  
The Trouble with Reality: A Rumination on Moral Panic in Our Time









  
  
    
  .On the other hand, Harari’s skepticism and pessimism in questioning prevailing views can seem a little too fatalistic; his views, at times, do not seem to offer someone like me with enough alternatives and options with which to advance or at least take next steps in coping beyond meditation----although perhaps that’s the place from which they come.  A contrasting foil might be the optimism in Pinker’s 

  
Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress









  
  
    
   where he puts more stock in reason, science and humanism (see my review of this book and others mentioned).Despite my criticism, Harari is very much worth reading for the way he portrays current human problems and those coming over the horizon that require our attention now and into the future.

  Humanity faces many threats, including the potential of future digital dictatorships pushing us into irrelevance. If we want to survive and flourish, humankind must transcend the divisions in the way of achieving a global community forging a common destiny. Resilience, creativity, critical thinking, collaboration, and really knowing who we are, will better prepare us to deal with change, to prevent the rise of nihilistic artificial intelligent systems, to find meaning in life, and stop suffering. Because the real enigma of life is not what happens after we die, but what happens before we die. That is how we can better understand life and create meaning, by feeling, by thinking, by desiring, and by inventing. And transferring that to create good. This is an important book by the author of Sapiens.

  I have read “21 Lessons for the 21st-Century” twice. The first time I enjoyed revisiting some of the same historical insights from the author of “Sapiens”. The second time was for a presentation at our general purpose book club. This time it seemed that Hariri was exaggerating risks (catastrophizIng) about the future without jobs and being manipulated by artificial intelligence via algorithms. His appreciation of algorithms and artificial intelligence seems unlimited, and he assumes that artificial intelligence can be made to be perfect or at least better than human efforts alone. He forgets that mankind’s mind is more like that of a chimpanzee than a truth machine and cannot be trusted to generate perfect algorithms. Harari included brief descriptions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam implying that these faiths contribute to many atrocities. He never mentions chimpanzee like male aggression and deception as a cause for human suffering and exploitation. Such people (Stalin, Mao, Hitler) have no problem twisting local myths and attracting co-conspirators  to overcome constitutions, laws, and commonsense in their pursuit of riches and power. I see no reason why the 21st-century will be any different from the previous ones, unless we learn to control aggression and deception. These outliers need to be recognized and defanged earlier before they enslave the many to benefit the few. Doesn’t this factor merit a mention as a cause of suffering and political disruption?

  ""21 Lessons ""is a good one ,but not up to the high standard of ""Sapiens"" and "" Homo Deus"" . Perhaps its most interesting point was the emphasis on EQ skills and mental resilience ( ""grit"" , in the parlance of Angela Duckworth ?! ) as the essential elements of education for the future. Also notable was Harari's unabashed statements about Vladimir Putin's Russia as the greatest threat to international security today .Otherwise, the book was interesting but all-too-predictable , somewhat vague in its treatment of concrete issues, and a bit too touchy-feely at the end.Hence-a good one, but not a great one like ""Sapiens"".

  Harari explores human life from his central concept: Humans are move by stories they believe. That illuminates almost everything... Except the key point of conscience. And without that, there is no explanation for why we choose to believe those stories and act them with our biographies.

  Could algorithms create digital dictators known only to a tiny elite while masses of humanity descend into a fortress of irrelevance  as a harbinger of social, economic, and political crises?  This is all a current bastion that we have no choice but to confront as the crucibles of unprecedented potential job losses with concomitant social and political upheavals descend into our social and financial safety nets.Artificial Intelligence is seen as a way of providing better and cheaper healthcare as algorithms replace traditional medical services.  Algorithms are increasingly involved in consumer opinions and decisions.Muslim nations will never adopt Western values and cultural integration will never be a successful Western ideal reality.Humanity is destabilizing the global biosphere as more and more substratum earth treasures are extracted en masse and replaced with an enormity of waste and poison.One contentious issue that remains among many Mexicans an irritant even though it dates to 1846.

  The writing is great - but writing about the present-future is obviously not his strong point (or as Yogi Bera said it - prediction is hard - especially about the future). It is excellent though in outlining what will not help solving the global issues - as it is an extension of historical trends (nationalism and religion will not help solve global problems).But in outlying major problems he seems to have lost his touch. Nuclear conflict and Climate Change (I read the later as Pollution - and not necessarily Climate Change). He chooses to name a class of new uses of computers as Artificial Intelligence and thinks that will evolve to replace humans in work areas. But people have dealt with other effects of industrial changes - by changing what they do - and the number of people involved in computer related activities will increase dramatically (computers developing their own software has theoretical limitations and is still several generations away - today computers can't even help test software without people directing them). Yes ... education has to change but it is definitely easier than what our ancestors had to do at the advent of industrialization.Overuse of earth resources is a problem but like pollution it is caused mainly by overpopulation. And overpopulation - an issue raised long ago by Malthus is not even listed by YNH as an issue! And not having a solution for many of our global perils is acceptable but not listing major issues such as overpopulation and over-exploration-of-resources is not acceptable for a historian of his repute.

  While I particularly didn’t like this book, I’ll give it two stars because it was well written. My issues are that a lot of the book is Yuval making quite a bit of assumptions (some false) and posing them as facts. This is a secular book, with a secular point of view, that’s is aimed for people who share the same ideology. So while the things he says may make sense to those and maybe get a few head nods and thumbs up, coming from a religious background, and knowing many friends who come from various religious backgrounds, there is not much substance I’m afraid to a lot of his religious arguments as the way he poses them are of the opinion of his own and not based on anything else. So if you’re into that, then maybe you’ll like this book. For those who do have a religious background, it may be interesting for you to see this alternative point of view. I think the chapter that got me the most was meditation. For someone who relinquishes all religion, he seems to have quite a fascination for meditation, which originated as a religious practice.

  21 Lessons for the 21st CenturyYuval Noah HarariReview by Author Roy Murry'Democrat politics, human rights, and free-market seem destined to conquer the entire world.' is one of lesson one's core points. I beg to differ. China actions, he does not consider.In 21 chapters, Mr. Harari opines on almost everything under the sun: Technology, Politics, Humanity, and His Truths. The philosophy and psychology of each he delves into with zeal and commitment.Whether you agree with him or not, his arguments and thesis are worth reading. I had to stop and read over several passages to understand his points fully.If you are a thinking person, I recommend this book to go along with others: Intellectuals and Society by Thomas Sowell and Jennifer Michael Hecht's DOUBT, a History.  They will open your eyes to what is happening in the 21st Century.One thing I loved about this book is that Mr. Harari's writing is clear and thought-provoking. Nihilist will be surprised.

  If this was another book, I would have given it a lesser rating. However, I read his other books and recognize this as an addendum of sorts. The conversational sense made sense. It drifted a bit and emphasized the same points several times but I think this topic demands it. Asus a student of history, I have always felt that history is more like a spider web that gets more complicated and fraught at its outer reaches. As a storyteller and social ""scientist"" and mixed blood, I have always been excruciatingly aware of narratives. Sometimes those that bind the social order also exclude those who are not meant to benefit. I think Harari makes a great point about this. Reckoning with our own progress will require mindful and diligent thought and action to the perils of our technology. If we want to embrace its opportunity and benefits, we will have to first reckon with the perils. It's an inclusive process. There's no time to sit on the sidelines and wait and see. As an American,I am amazed every day that our legislators bicker over the same topic--the personality of the president. That makes him more important than climate change, AI and machine learning, nanotechnology,big data, block chain,biotechnology, cyberwarfare, etc. Harari does a great job of saying otherwise. If liberalism has a prayer of surviving, our elected representatives will need to get work and shutter the special interests that seem to ""distract"" them. This is a great book like his others.

  This book is a great addition to Sapiens and Homo Deus. The ideas in this book have had me talking to friends about it, and I love that about Harari's writing and ideas. I specifically liked the chapter entitled ""God."" It is short and sweet--has really had me thinking. And I loved the last chapter entitled ""Meditation."" This humanized the author and has had me thinking more about the value of giving my mind a rest. Overall, the author is more open about himself in this book, and I appreciate that--he has become somewhat of an icon and he seems to be stepping in to the role well. I plan to read Harari's books as fast as he can write them. What a great addition to my book collection, and what a great addition to our contemporary great thinkers. Thank you!

  This book unlike his fact based book ""Sapiens"" is speculative and philosophical.  Author is obsessed with AI, Big Data and computer algorithms.  I most liked his sub-chapter ""Spaceship Earth.""  He gives easy pass to all religions in his chapters on Religion, God and Tolerance. A simple observation should have told him that Monotheistic religions are inherently intolerant, while Polytheistic religions have no reason to be intolerant. By definition Monotheistic have one God and that means any other God of any other religion is unacceptable. All sorts Polytheistic religions have hundreds or thousands of Gods! Examples are ancient Egyptians, ancient Greeks, modern Shinto and modern Hindus have so many gods that no single person can keep track of them. So if your neighbor worships a hawk or eagle while you worship a tree who is going to know what a false god is! This is why Polytheism accepts all gods even some outside their religion. That makes Polytheism far more tolerant of other beliefs.

  21 Lessons for the 21st Century is the cherry on top of three great books (Sapiens, 2015 and Homo Deus, 2017) by Yuval Noah Harari.  He has an incredible way of zooming out to 40,000 feet and making you feel as though you are studying humanity through an observation glass.A simple lesson I think anyone can take from this book is that everything about the way our society is structured was done by humans, which means humans can change it.  Nothing is set in stone.  Nothing is the way it is because of natural law.Maybe the best compliment I can give about all three of Yuval’s books is that they have motivated me to get out and travel and see the world.  It’s kind of incredible to think that after 3.5 billion years of life evolving on Earth, we are the first living things able to look back and study and appreciate that journey.

  Its a great book and discusses a lot of issues that AI/current wave of nationalism in the US and EU/future jobs/health care. Its a great book for anyone to read and especially if you are working in Public Policy.The section abt future of health care where uber rich could cheat death or get the best possible healthcare whereas common plebs will left to die is scary but very relatable. Especially with the COVID-19 right now it can be said that the book truly echoed the fact that the disease doesn't discriminate between rich and poor but the treatment does.It helps to also understand why the US is functioning or rather dysfunction politically and understand the mind of religious fanatics (evangelics/so called god fearing christians/isis in Middle East) and the weak minds of swindled republican voters as well.All in all a great modern philosophy book to learn about range of topics and the author has put a cohesive argument for each of the topics.

  Harari focuses on the current issues and gives us hints to tackle them.One of the strong points of Harari is that he thinks in a broad perspective that we rarely do. This is perhaps because he is a historian who knows well what has happened in the last few thousand years. When he thinks, he thinks in multiple perspectives---he can think ""outside the box"", which makes his books so inspiring and fun to read.Harari writes logically and clearly when he uses his imagination. Some of the future scenarios he predicts are realistic and scary at the same time.In this book, Harari points out that free will is a myth---our desires and decisions are mere results of biochemical reactions. As Harari mentioned, free will is a concept fabricated by Christianity (scientists have already proven that we don't have free will). If a new world order (post-liberalism fiction) is to be created in the 21st century, I believe that this fact---non-existence of free will---should be the foundation of it.

  3.5 stars, well, rounded up to 4. Among the 3 books, my favorite is Sapiens and 21 Lessons is the least. I dunno, the first 30% is good (I could easily give 5 stars), but the rest is boring and sounds repetitive, some of them are just repetition of his earlier work (Sapiens and Homo Deus). Though, I have a lot of highlight and note in this book, some I’ve found new to me, some argument I could agree with and some not. Some topics don’t really relate with the topic title, such as the education part. I also mostly don’t find his narrative – Christian, Islam, communist etc – is very engaging, it is sounds just like a personal argument that does not have some scientific back up. I could agree with him with AI, yes it could be useful for humans – transportation, medical etc – but I couldn’t find any wrong with it, I believe that we still control the algorithms, because we create them. But yeah, my mostly complains is just this book is very repetitive.

  Here is my annotation related to the the use of algorithms for lending.Hmmm, Harari is demonstrating a lack of understanding.1) credit decisions have been made by algorithms for over 20 years.2) the algorithms produce decline reasons, if needed. This is tied to the independent variable (s) that drove the decision.  For example, if the customer was recently seriously delinquent on an existing loan, this maybe the driver for the decline.3)  FCRA and HMDA are regulations relevant to fair lending. For example, HMDA requires independent testing to detect discriminatory activity

  I loved the author's earlier books Sapiens and Homo Deus.  His writing is clear, accessible and engaging, if a little sarcastic at times, so this book was really a disappointment.  While I don't disagree with most of his well argued points about the challenges we face, his last few chapters extolling meditation as a solution are simply bizarre.  The books feels arrogant and ultimately not very useful in looking forward to how we might use the insights to address real and pressing issues facing humanity in the immediate and near future.

  I have personally benefited from reading the book and learned quite a few new things about how to understand the world of today and tomorrow. Yuval is like a father explaining complex things in simple words, or scary things in non-scary ways to a child. From understanding why we shouldn’t fear terrorism, but should truly be concerned about how AI and ML will affect the job market, how I should think about my kids’ future vocations and what to think of religion vs being “secular”.Oh and, coming from Russia, my favorite discovery was his statement that Russia only pretends to be a democracy. Finally someone has said it in a way that is so crisp and accurate!Highly recommended.

  Came into this book blind, but not what I was expecting.  Was basically a long opinion piece based on skewed facts and strong bias.  It preaches humility while claiming I am God!  He makes points, which put a thousand objections in my mind, but then rambles on to make those objections I'm thinking in a weird way.  Sorta maybe making a point, but also not making the point while providing no solution?  He tries to make points, but completely misuses facts, or skips from facts to fiction so quickly he'll hope you don't notice.  It was infuriating to get through.  It discusses some very interesting concepts, but provides nothing more unique than what you could find in a good sci-fi or war movie.  Highly do not recommend.

  He has a nice way of capturing idioms. Could be employed to create tomorrow's cliches. The first third was not original, just journalism as history. The middle section had more heft, but the Devil is in the details and he is not a details person. The last third was another tired effort to define ""mind"" in terms of self awareness and meditation. If it works for Dr Harari, well, good for him. His earlier books seem very popular and the consensus seems to be, based on those two books, that he is very insightful and shrewd. My impression from this book is that he is just another historian as journalist. Amusing but not substantial.

  After reading Sapiens and Homo Deus, I couldn't wait to read 21 Lessons, Yuval Harari's newest book. Following the successful formula of its previous bestsellers, in this book, the author keeps its thorough analysis of a broad range of questions that occupy our thoughts. Yuval does that brilliantly. His well grounded analysis, profound insights, and clear writing bring some light on difficult subjects such as nationalism, immigration, and religion. Indeed, 21 Lessons is a very good complement for Sapiens and Homo Deus and a must read for Yuval Harari's fans.

  Harari is a beacon in the troubled waters of our current age.  He details climate change, disruptive technology, and the new biology as the chief problems of our age.  None of them can be solved by nations alone.  All are global.  Each is explained with extensive references. The bibliography alone is worth the price of the book.  Harari has a philosophy for dealing with the massive change coming in the next few years which he describes in the last few chapters.  I found that part of the book less useful and possibly flawed.  I will read this book again because it is worth the time.

  I originally had to read this book for college and I enjoyed it so much and I love the way the chapters are broken up and clear to follow. So glad my teacher had us read this instead of the same old books. This is new and interesting to read and makes you really think.Decided to order a copy to send to my brother whose serving time right now in prison.I can not tell you how much he loved it and want me to send him more like this. I sent him multiple fantasy and interesting books but this one he said he keeps rereading. I'm sorry, this review probably is not that helpful but I just wanted to share this because it made me so happy. My brother was never a big reader, or big on school and I don't think we've ever had a conversation about world issues, but something told me he needed this book and I think he's gained a lot from it. I would like to just thank Yuval Noah Harari for this book and thank you for peaking my brother's interest and helping him see the world outside the bad one he was in.

  I used to think I was an open-minded, progressive freethinker and a reasonably enlightened scientist until I read Sapiens, Homo Deus, and 21 Lessons. These books changed my way of evaluating the world and assessing other people's evaluations. Harari's concepts of  ""if it makes someone suffer, then it's wrong"" (and I'm sorry if I'm oversimplifying it) and ""almost everything we think of as real is a story"" made deep impressions on me. Simple, powerful, undeniable. Why didn't I think of these myself?

  Harari sometimes gets a little too overbearing in his exposition, but this book is mostly a serious enumeration of what we will face in the near and the not-so-distance future. From job displacement by A.I. and robots to climate change, he covers 21 areas. There are no easy answers and the purpose of this book is to get people to realize that we have to start thinking beyond ideologies or human civilization may be transformed by problems of our own making in ways that we will find undesirable. We also have to adopt long-term strategies very much in the way the Long Now Foundation advocates, which is my extension of Harari's themes.

  Ideas revolucionarias, interpretaciones nunca vistas de la realidad, pero expresadas con un estilo sencillo, tanto que parecen obvias. Su prosa tiene elementos de ironía sutiles, a veces no tanto, y un estilo que mantiene el interés del lector. La gran pregunta para todos es: y ahora que nos mostraron como son las cosas, ¿que debemos hacer? Porque sería extraño no cambiar algo en cada uno de nosotros, después de darse este paseo de lujo por el presente y el futuro cercano. Muy recomendable.

  Not a fast read. Should read it twice, and fully research the background of his conclusions. For example, his allegation that artificial intelligence can take over the world is pure science fiction. But his observations regarding the dangers of governmental misuse of facial recognition technology,  documented by a lengthy article in the Atlantic magazine describing its use by the Chinese, is chillingly true. A lot of people should be actively seeking legislative controls on many of his concerns.

  This is a great book for many reasons.  One of the things I loved best about it is that it really helped me to understand  the current political, religious, global and technological predicaments by explaining relevant historical data.  It's revelational.  I did find his vision of our technological future unbelievable, but as he explained how he got to that outcome, I could see how he got there.  I still feel doubtful about it, but there is room for doubt too.

How is everything all related and why.  Where is it going.  I have read many books about independent subjects in each of its own context, but this book ties everything together and makes sense of it.I thoroughly enjoyed ready this book.

  I read this book, over many hours, for discussion within a book club group. It was thorough in its world overview & current problems. I haven’t read many books that are so expansive, so it enlarged my knowledge base greatly. It was also very disturbing because of the problems we have to grapple with, & our history of how humans have handled problems.  The concluding chapters disappointed me.  They did not have the breadth of the first part of the book.  In fact, Harari didnotoffer any solutions.

  I have little in common with this author and do not always agree with his conclusions.  However, this book sizzles with intelligence and wit, inviting the reader to contemplate (sometimes with trepidation) the future realities that are even now, in many cases, becoming the norm.  I so enjoy the scope and vision of an author who actively engages in intelligent speculation about what's to come and how we will face it.

It is also not a good source of information: while all statements are mostly correct, they are rarely acurate.

  Yuval brings up some interesting philosophical conundrums. Some probably have to be addressed at some point and others seem far fetched or far off into the future. My problem is that he questions many things but seems to totally accept current western medicine to be this infallible system. In this book in particular runs down a list of what some traditional therapies would do for disease in a somewhat condescending manner, then concludes that current western medicine says we are made of up cells and disease is only caused by pathogens, and you take antibiotics and your disease goes away. This simple statement proves how little he knows of physiology, medicine, and disease. Right there he discounts how much the state of your immune system impacts disease and disease prevention. He also doesn’t account for the subsequent damage and compromise to the immune system that antibiotics take on our bodies, resulting in further disease.  He should stick to what he is educated in, which is sociology and social science. Believing in the reductionistic system of pharmaceutical medicine and discounting traditional healing methods makes this guy sound like a boob.

  This book is call to humanity to get things straight now or otherwise face a bleak future. We may be entering major changes with infotech, biotech and global warming never seen before. Just hope is not as negative as the author suggests it could be. Yuval dances with words and probably this is the reason his message gets home really clearly. Yuval is also my favorite atheist, mentions 128 times God and is normal because God (s) has been (or we believe he has) with humanity all along the ride. Maybe religion is not the solution but does provide some order in society. The last 3 lessons, Education, Meaning, Meditation were my favorite as they are a guide for the future in the mind of the author. My conclusion from Yuval's work and would say for Homo-Sapiens and Homo-Deus books is the difficult evolution we have had with suffering being constant. We have evolved from oppression from other humans, from religious ism's, form ignorance, injustice and war but still far from being human in the best meaning.

  The book was delivered promptly and in excellent condition (new, wrapped in plastic wrap).This is one of the best books I've read in a long time, along with the same author's Sapiens, which was the first in the series. His 2nd book in the series, Homo Deus is good, but not as good as the 1st and 3rd. Harari is very unusual for a historian. He has broad knowledge in many fields, is perceptive, open-minded, and thinks outside the box.

  The author clearly has a way with great one-liners but this book is highly repetitive.  The next to last chapter on Meaning is particularly verbose and then, the last chapter which presents a so-called solution, is a cop out.  Finally, after reading for over three hundred pages how we are being manipulated by external forces--the internet, Facebook etc.  it was illuminating to read in the acknowledgments a big shout out to his PR firm for mounting such a successful campaign for his book.

  I have read other books written by Yuval Noah Harari, such as Sapiens and Homo Deus. I am impressed by what he demonstrated about the core philosophy regarding our human kind and society. He does not only presented sociology or other single aspect about our species. He combined all current science, technology, history, legal study, and politic science to explain what we truly are. Comparing previous books, the 21 lessons for the 21st Century is more likely to explore what we are going to face in the future time. His words are straightforward and worth taking time to read it.

  ""When a thousand people believe some made-up story for one month-that's fake news. When a billion people believe it for a thousand years - that's a religion.""...there are many such insightful observations throughout the book. Covering a wealth of information from work to terrorism to community and 18 other topics. There is a warning that the combination of biotech and infotech could make a lot of people useless being unable to compete with automation. Terrorist groups are seen as weak and likened to a fly in a china shop, which gets in the ear of a bull to wreck the shop. There is much to digest in these 21 lessons.

  This is a very insightful and balanced perspective on how technology and genetics science is changing our world and what the social and economic consequences may be.

  The author, Yuval Noah Harari, makes a strong case for his 21 lessons - well researched, insightful and well structured. he covers everything that makes us who we are and the peculiar and challenging situations we all find ourselves in, fuelled by technology development and the societal and cultural evolutions. His challenge to believes and religions can be controversial for some, I've found it refreshing. I've read the first 20 lessons more as 20 challenges and  how they came about and only lesson 21 as the real lesson: not to loose humanity or what makes us human through self observation. How many will follow his advice?

  This is a thought-provoking read. If we can change and or implement some of the guidelines from Mr. Harari's book, or just have as many people read it, the 21st Century can be guided in a more productive and mindful way. I find most of his views leaning towards the Left with a more socialist type concept being explained as possible fixes for the future. Whatever your views are or Mr. Harari's, it's still a provoking must-read.

  The third book (of three) that I've read by this author. His provocative thesis about the impending evolution of our species confirmed for me a number of issues about who we are and why. The only surprise is the minimal opposition to his thesis by just about every commentator on contemporary society and historical institutions.

  Yuval Noah Harari brilliantly describes the circumstances that have led us to our present and paints a near future that’s either disappointing or downright frightening.

  Loved Home Deus by the same author, but found 21 Lessons to be sadly lacking. It is a collection of mostly rambling philosophical essays that Harari apparently thinks have some relationship to the 21st century. The book feels like a commercial marketing effort dreamed up by Harari's publisher to sell one more book while the author's reputation is deservedly hot. A huge disappointment compared to Sapiens and Home Deus. In the shadow of those powerful books, two stars is generous.

  I listened to the chapter on Meaning in which the author gave a good explanation on how religion and philosophy provided a framework of meaning but he ends the chapter disappointingly by staying these stories aren't true, no good reason given why they aren't true and in the end he dogmatically says there is no meaning, how does he know this?,and we have to suck it up and live with it but in the mean time we should seek to relieve suffering. I agree with that but for different reasons. After all if life is meaningless why should I?...I think he should have told us he borrowed this philosophy whole cloth from Camus. I think I'm returning the book..

The stories humans have invented over the millenia are just that, stories, and not necessarily truth.  Very thought-provoking.

  Periodically I’ve tried to think of the author as the Malcolm Gladwell for the 21st-century. However I am struck by his deadening tone. That said, I’ll give him this: he has the guts to call out religion. But his logic lacks the poetry of the human condition. To me, there’s something beautiful going on here (in the universe, that is) and while religion may be way off course, good art pretty much gets it. Unfortunately , Prof. Harari doesn’t.

  Homo Sapiens = infinite stars. A fair rating for an outstanding book (Homo Sapiens). Homo Deus boring and rather predictable if you read other books on the subject. Mostly intertwining free will and neuroscience. This one, 21 Lessons, has high points and boring low. I guess the writer needs more time and less hurry to produce as book at the level of Homo Sapiens. 3 stars out of respect. Yuval becomes the risk to become the Dan Brown of science. One excellent book and a bunch of boring sequels.

  This is the third of the three seminal books by Harari. Sapiens followed by Homo Deus are the other two. To get the full arc, one should read all three in order.  21 leaves you at the threshold of the indefinite future. Harari is the most profound and iconoclastic thinker about culture and humankind working today.

  Great book that will be disconcerting for perhaps all and intolerable for some. I do feel that for the briefest moment the author begins to fall prey to one of the key thinking errors he purports. This involves a very brief undeveloped comment at the end of the book that leaves open the possibility the “mind” is somehow separate from the brain. It would be great to be able to explore the thought process with the author.

  This is one of those books that you can’t put down. It is filled with ideas to challenge the very things you were taught without questioning.

  If one was drawn and intrigued by everything Yuval Harari has to say about Homo sapiens, our beings and beyond in his 2 books and may not understand why, his third book '21st lessons...' explains all as to why you should keep paying attention to his words and thoughts and apply the principles to oneself to explore  an entirely new world of human existence in infinity.

  The several uncalled for references by the author to his sexual orientation surprised me. After carefully reading the book, I realized that there were not so uncalled for. I got the impression that the idea of the book was to, along with brilliant and deep thoughts, attack in a subtle way all those values that confront said orientation.  It loses the objectivity one expected from otherwise worth reading book.

  It took me almost a year to finish this collective essays of Yuval Noah Harari. While reading this book, I usually stopped in days even in months and thought a lot on what he tried to tell.

  Amazing book, not my first read by this author. Yuval has a very clear way to deliver the information as is and combined with his own personal point of view. It might come clearer for me since we share the same ideology but the simplicity and his straight forward of an approach is highly practical (to my personal opinion).Albert Einstein once said, if you could not explain your agenda to a child it means you haven’t understood it yourself to begin with.And clearly Mr. Harari had mastered that approach with great success.Over all A+++

I found brilliant - perhaps because I never paid attention to the concept and its practice !you will find other things that may interest you more..what you will not find (unless I missed out on it) are discussions on the Earth's population problem, on the decline of natality in the ""West"", on abortion, on gender-ideology.....I admit that on not a few pages I found H sounding like a wise guy - you may detect that I know about that...I bought the book out of curiosity, not expecting much...I got more than I expectedYour decision ! don't blame me !Alex TrierSantiago, Chile

  Authors become famous because they can explain complexity by weaving macro and micro forces. They give us insights that are not easy to find. Unfortunately, once they become famous, they also tend to sometimes think that every thought they have is profound. They reach into their rich networks to get fabulous reviews.

  This is the third book I’ve read by Harari, and the one I liked least.  It ends up being a polemic for the virtues of meditation.  I’ve nothing against meditation, but the practice is hardly the force for good argued by the author.  Moreover, I’m generally more optimistic about the future than Harari is, and especially about the potential for good from technology.  In my opinion, Harari would benefit from reading Pinker’s latest book, “Enlightenment Now”, followed by a stiff drink.

  Lots of challenges to life, experience, reality, and the way we (I) understand them. Sometimes too much sceptykal, almost nihilistic, but the author never leaves a thought or a challenge unexplained.

  This is not just a good book. This is an important book. One of the first things I realized in reading this book by Malcolm Gladwell is that his position is diametrically opposite from that of Dr. Ben Carson, who through his campaign for the presidency stated that ""poverty is a state of mind."" Carson emphasized that despite all odds he was able to pull himself out of poverty and become a neurosurgeon and accomplish the things he did.Gladwell's book states early that success doesn't happen in a vacuum. It isn't based on intelligence, but on a variety of factors, and he uses multiple examples to demonstrate that we as a nation could have many more successful people in our country if we were to accept that it takes a village to make successes out of our children. In fact, he shows that hard work and opportunity in almost all cases are more important than intelligence.One story tells of the Canadian hockey league and the fascinating statistic that the vast majority of all successful hockey players are born in January, February or March. Why? Because the cutoff date for signing children is January 1, and those born in the first three months have a distinct advantage in age, experience and size in relation to those they play against. That same cutoff date is used by other countries, such as the Czech Republic, for not only hockey but soccer as well, which means that children born in the later part of the year consistently are overlooked when it comes to team sports. It's a built-in bias.These biases are all around us, and determine who succeeds or fails, constantly. In addition, the bias of a culture has a significant effect on how well a student does. Gladwell talks about the belief that Asians are better at math, which he shows is because their languages are more number-friendly, leading children to count earlier, and which make math simpler. In addition, he shows the inherent tradition of hard work of southern China had resulted in a work ethic for their descendants that continues today.Many of the stories are supported with statistics. One of the most eye-opening to me was his observation of the impact on summer vacation. Statistics show that the amount that lower-, middle-, and upper-class students learn in elementary school each year isn't that significantly different. But when you compare what they learn or forget over summer vacation, there is a significant discrepancy. Upper-class parents keep their children busy with lessons and classes all summer, while in most situations lower and even middle-class students don't do much during the summer and often forget much of what they have learned the previous year. As the summers add up, the problem compounds. And so the difference between upper, middle and lower class widens.The book is significant, easy to read, and extremely thought provoking. I highly recommend it.

  I came in from reading Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow, expecting scientific, statistically backed, thoughtfully reasoned bite-sized chunks of knowledge. Instead, I felt like I was reading a tabloid writer's stream-of-consciousness brain dump of trivia. Breaking down my disappointment into four general categories:1.) Negative -- excessively so. Human deaths are treated like numbers, lives categorized as ""success"" or ""failure"" as if no shade of gray existed. One of the few ""genius"" cases studied, Chris Langan is portrayed as a failed human being for being unable to negotiate financial aid or a change in class schedule. The author conveniently treats his college dropout as his fault for lacking ""savvy... to get what he wanted from the world."" Gladwell compares Langan to Oppenheimer, making random connections to a scientist from a different era, jumping to conclusions in comparing two people that didn't even deal with the same problems. Providing painstaking second-by-second detail into the final moments of Korean Airlines' 801 crash. Belittling poor families for letting their children choose their own pastimes. Morbidly dramatizing the family feud between the Howards and the Turners, when the point of the chapter/lesson benefited from no such detail. There's such an obsession with death and negativity that I found the book difficult to digest and follow without compartmentalizing large chunks. The book drained me of any positivity and hope each time I read one of these startlingly negative case studies.2.) Rambling -- small talk, irrelevant facts thrown in as gossip. History lessons and useless divergences abound. Wasted words, either to drive home points as dramatically as possible, or feign scientific expertise under the guise of trivia knowledge. The detailed who-killed-who in a family feud has no relevance to the topic at hand. I don't care how many cases of insanity a random educator studied in 1871, or how many people died on a plane crash. Even the aizuchi in a cockpit conversation seemed over-the-top. More than half of several pages in the book contain fine-print-sized sidenotes that constituted little more than divergences or parenthetical remarks, which, though, interesting, didn't add much credibility; on the contrary, it made it seem as if the author didn't take the time to cull irrelevance and move interesting topics into an appendix, or into the body of the text itself. An editor needed to take a fine-toothed comb and cut the fat by about half. Ultimately, when I found myself meandering down one of these divergences, I skipped entire paragraphs and pages to reach the thesis or the point.3.) Jumping between vignettes with little to no transition. Chapters often begin with a long divergent story without introduction, without even stating the point or relevance to topic at hand. It was hard to get interested or invested in these stories because (a.) I knew these people were going to die, and (b.) there wasn't even the slightest hint as to why this story would be relevant. Then, before the author made the connection, he'd jump to another story, another divergence. For example, in studying the importance and influence of culture on plane crashes, the author jumped from a Korean Air cockpit to a discussion of Russia, to the cockpit of a flight from Dubai with Colombian crew, all without so much as a transition or thesis sentence. I was left wondering what happened to the Korean flight, then what it had to do with outliers -- particularly successful or bright people -- then assigning faces to more names, more cultural generalizations. The book is full of random jumps between scenes without so much as a transition. It was confusing and frustrating to parse.4.) Unstatistical -- The book suffers from a heavy dose of WYSIATI -- What You See Is All There Is. Cases are brought into light conveniently when the author wants to make a point, and just as conveniently dismissed or not mentioned when they don't support the point. A study following families and the way they raise their children surveyed only 12 families (!) -- a minuscule sample size -- then makes generalizations about the influence of two parental styles: rich and entitled vs. poor and meek. Similarly, a case study on Marita in the KIPP Academy program focuses entirely on the positives of discipline in her schedule, without comment or perspective on its rigidity. Never mind that she had no more friends from her old school, or how much sleep she was losing. All that seemed to matter was the author's point that certain environments can elevate the poor. The prowess of Asian students in mathematics, compared to English-speaking Western children, is explained away by the shortness and ease-of-pronunciation of the Chinese words for numbers, without any brain studies, control groups, or consideration of cultural emphases on study and discipline. Langan is compared to Oppenheimer simply because the author was reminded of one of them when interviewing Langan. Many explanations, however convenient or logical, focus on a single fact or coincidence with little regard for alternatives or counter-arguments. With rare exceptions, statistics, when presented, don't seem to tie to any particular cited journal or brain study. When a conclusion is reached, it seems plausible only because the story - the tabloids, the drama, the convenience - seems solid, not because all the facts have been considered and the science consulted.Overall, I don't feel like I came away from the book more enlightened or educated about the environments around geniuses or success stories. Instead, I felt like I finished watching a season of Encounters, live TV trying to explain phenomena like crop circles through random anecdotal accounts and sounding smart by mixing in some interviews. I don't recommend this book to the scientifically inclined.

  Have you ever wondered why some people prevail and live remarkably successful lives while others fail to reach their full potential?Malcolm Gladwell explores the different factors that decide the difference between successful and unsuccessful people. We learn what rock stars, geniuses and computer programmers have in common. He explains that success is not just a matter of IQ, but a combination of hard work and opportunity. In Outliers, Gladwell hooks the reader by first providing an anecdote and explaining the common misconceptions that people have about that situation and then completely turns our understanding of how they got to be successful on its head.This book includes stories of why January first is the ideal birthday for a hockey player, how the work ethic determined by Jewish immigrants making clothes lead to them becoming successful lawyers, how Asians working in rice paddies has developed a culture which excels at math, and how performing for 10,000 hours in Hamburg decided the Beatles’ rise to fame. While this book was enjoyable for this trivia alone, Gladwell manages to change our perception of success entirely, because timing, circumstance, and even luck are major factors that decide a person’s success. Sometimes the disadvantaged actually have all the advantages in the world just because they happened to be born in the right place at the right time. We have to examine all the factors surrounding a successful individual which all had to come together in order for him or her to be an outlier.Gladwell bases most of his anecdotes and explanations on research conducted by others and I wish he would have gone into more detail about how these studies were conducted and how reliable they actually are but this is the only complaint I have about this book. He is a very charming and enthusiastic story teller, he thoroughly explains his thought process without rambling and kept me interested and engaged throughout the whole book. Overall I enjoyed reading Outliers and I would definitely recommend it to others.

  This book changed the way I look at things. Gladwell breaks success down into a few components:Meaningfulness - The thing has to have some meaning for you, some deep meaning.  You need this to create or have a desire or need to do the thing - you won't do it if there's no need to do it, or no desire.Expertise - Which is different from ""success.""  It takes 10,000 hours of consistent, deliberate practice to become ""expert"" at something.  If you have the desire/need, you won't mind putting in the time.Support - No one does anything alone.  Every successful person had support from someone at some critical point in time.History - Your own genealogical history will have a huge impact on what your do - how you act/react regarding things.  Your personal history will have a similarly huge impact - how you view the world is based on your experience of it from an early age.Culture - The culture you were raised in, and the culture you live/work in, will determine your behavior to a large extent, unless you're really aware of it, and can work with it.Luck - It takes a lot of luck to be ""successful.""  You have to be in the right places at the right times.  You have to have all of the cards stacked up in your favor.There are some things we just can't get around.  Our genes, for instance.  Our family history.  Our past.  Those things are done.  The good thing is, they are done.  We don't have to think about them, unless they create impediments for us.  If they do, we need to deal with them and get over/around those issues.We can't really get around luck, either...though some people feel like we make our own luck (and I tend to agree).  We can do our best to stack the cards in our favor, to create Win/Win situations whenever possible, and walk away from situations that are Lose/Win, or Win/Lose.  That will go a long way.  Maybe as far as luck itself can at times.The rest of it is simply finding what's most meaningful to us, and being true to it.  It takes a lot of work, a lot of bravery, a lot of soul-searching.  But when it's all over, wouldn't you rather be able to say you used your life to become who you really are?  That you realized your fullest potential?  The alternative seems very sad.

  One of my past pupils recommended that I read this study in June 2018. I picked it up from Amazon and began to read it on a journey to San Antonio, and completed it on the return trip to Berkeley.Author Malcolm Gladwell tells us that what we usually consider the heart of a success story is really off the mark. There are no self-made successes. ""Outliers"", people who excel, have many others to thank, including family members who lived two or three generations before their births. They have opportunities, yes, and they have hours to practice, to study, to rehearse, to experiment -- thousands of hours, in fact. In addition, they also have those who encourage them in making social contacts, in ways to best present themselves and their ideas. High IQ and native talent are not enough; being comfortable in the social context makes the great difference.Gladwell introduces his essay with an assessment of the people of Roseto (Pennsylvania) of mid-1900s - how their good health and extraordinary longevity defied American averages. What medical researchers found is that Roseto's population of Italian immigrants and their descendants spent time with each other, and resolved issues by confiding in each other. They shared their meals and never rushed Sunday dinner, which was always intergenerational. The people of Roseto did not die of heart disease or cancer. They died of old age (I relate to this because, as an Italian-American, I have been interested in the story of Roseto for decades).The essay ends with Gladwell telling the story of racial mixing in Jamaica in the 19th century, and how slavery ended there well before it did in the USA, how opportunities were offered and taken, and lives improved, racism died, solidarity became solid, and people found meaning (The Jamaican Story becomes a revelation to the reader at the end).Between these bookends, Gladwell examines the stories of hockey stars, rock stars, geniuses, inventors, tailors, lawyers, nuclear physicists, and other outliers -- and Gladwell finds patterns in their upbringing and in the mentoring that they received that made them, if not exceptional, incredibly proficient.This essay is an important contribution to the study of education, parenting and policy-making. I highly recommend ""Outliers: The Story of Success"".

  I received the book in the mail yesterday, and I'm almost done. It's a very easy read.  The author proves, through a series of logical examples, that those that our society deem ""the great ones"", have more to do with a series of lucky breaks meeting preparation than some innate ability.  That being said, the book gave me hope.  It is definitely NOT written in a hopeful or inspirational tone.  Its redundant points are presented very logically and matter-of-fact (other reviewers say ""boring"").  Potato/po-tah-to... Example after example....after example, the pattern that emerged for me was destiny is real, that even as early as our birth, the universe is conspiring to lead us in the direction of our purpose.  We each have a series of ""lucky"" breaks as well as unfortunate events that are directing our paths. We can chose to lean in and pursue or be crushed by the redirection.  Once I shifted my focus, the authors examples were exciting and eye-opening.  As I said, I've not yet completed the book.  Gladwell may very well bring it together in this way by the end (fingers crossed), but regardless, reading it from that aspect makes it much more of a page turner.

  There are many books on the market that dissect success. They often talk about perseverance, determination, creativity, and hard work. What Malcolm Gladwell has done in 'Outliers' is take a deep dive into the rarely examined factors that give an edge to one set of gifted individuals over a similarly gifted set. Sometimes the factors are beyond the control of people, such as a team of hockey players who were born within a set few months of the year versus those athletes born in other months. Or the creative types who practice their art a minimum of 10,000 hours versus those who practice less. Each chapter is an eye-opener and sheds a bright light on what makes someone a success and someone else, with similar skills, less of a success. Gladwell's style is a journalistic matter of fact tone which will keep you reading while clearly understanding the points being made. This book does a fine job of investigating each surprising case study without lecturing or making the material too complicated to understand. For anyone who has ever wondered why maybe they or their child or spouse didn't succeed where someone else who was no smarter or more gifted did succeed, this book might offer a clue. It's a must have. Highly recommended.

  Do yourself a favor. Get this book. Read it and share its lessons with your children.Malcolm Gladwell expertly blends behavioral psychology with Freakonimics. Yes, natural talents and desire are essential for greatness, but there is so much more to understand about these disparate stories of success; each, in some way an anomoly.Some common themes prevail thoughout this book; and explain the unique circumstances that allowed rare talents to flourish. Opportunity born of luck or circumstance have given extraordinary talents like Bill Gates the unique exposure to computer resources when few others could. The author explains the rare circumstances that allowed individuals born within a uniquely small window of history to produce the extraordinary successes of Apple and Microsoft and Oracle.The book expertly explores the cultural influences of Jews emigrating to the US from Europe, and how their circumstances contributed to their unique successes following the rise of the garment industries in NY. The author also discovers the statistical anomoly of birth dates and how physical maturity plays an arbitrary role in who ultimately succeeds in competitive ice hockey in Canada. Each new use case is as fascinating and thought-provoking as the last.This is a fascinating and informative book that will keep you yearning for more. You'll wish you had 10,000 hours to devote to mastering your craft!

  Interesting stories and statistics about how ""life is not fair"".We all know that is true, but the details are often quite interesting.  For example, most professional athletes are born in the first half of the year. Poor children learn about as well as rich kids during the year, but fall behind during the summer. Deference to authority can lead to plane crashes.The main thesis of this book is that we should reject the myth of the ""self-made man"" because there are precise factors that lead to anyone's success: being born in a certain year or being given a rare opportunity. And I think Gladwell is correct in this.But he tells stories of success only. What about the stories or failures or of criminals? Can't we make the same argument for those people? If that's the case how do we justify punishing people for their crimes when their circumstances were beyond their control.It may be that Gladwell would agree on a more compassionate justice system, but by only focusing on the outliers on one side of the tail the book feels shallow and unsatisfying.Still, I give it 4 stars because I think it is worth the read and it is entertaining.

  Initially I enjoyed this book, until I realized that many of the conclusions that Gladwell came to were wrong.Throughout the book he brings up various bits of information and facts on a topic that he has discovered. He'll dig a little deeper into the topic and draw a conclusion from this. The problem with this is his information/data is incomplete and misleading on numerous topics.I researched a few of the topics because I found them interesting and wanted to learn more. After doing this research it became apparent that Gladwell is either jumping to conclusions with incomplete research or is going out of his way to prove a point cherry picking data.Based on what I've researched I've found significant errors with the following topics:-Canadian hockey players-10,000 hour rule-Top NYC Lawyers-Schooling in the US vs other countriesBased on this it's difficult for me to believe any of the other topics in this book. PLEASE do your own research before just believing everything you read in this book.

  Outliers, by Malcolm Gladwell gives the stories of men and women whodo things out of the ordinary. The reader will learn about the successof people of all walks of the working life, from geniuses to rockstars, pilots, and even the rise of the author’s own family inJamaica. Gladwell even goes as far as to challenge the way we think ofsuccess. He takes the reader through many examples of success storiesand finds a common thread to connect them all. This work shines lighton the subject of success in a way never shown before, emphasizingthat no one makes it to the top on their own. The organization of thisbook is very interesting and easy to read. Gladwell gives manyspecific examples of events that are all related to his main point,then refers to them throughout the book tying all of the examplestogether. I was happy to read about success stories as opposed toother nonfiction pieces that can be more depressing stories of war orpolitics. Overall, this is a very impressive work that gave a new wayto think about success.  -Charlie S.Copyright 2008 by Malcolm Gladwell- Little, Brown and Company,Hachette Book Group.

  Reading Outliers as someone with a couple decades of professional experience, and many years more of a committed drive toward excellence, I was encouraged. 10,000 hours sounds great. I have that easily and am enjoying success in my career. This book appeals to my ego, really.Only I don't think 10,000 is a real number. We can point to examples of great successes with less experience. And to so-called failures with 20,000 hours in. Success is a messy word.Lebron James hardly had this when he started with the MBA. Michael Jackson when he was first big with the Jackson 5. Shirley Temple too. She started when she was three.Meanwhile, all those athletes who are forgotten thanks to just missing a medal may have more hours than can be counted. Or the local theater. It is filled with actors who never made it to Broadway or Hollywood.I think this book is not without merit in its fundamental point: work long and work hard and good things may come. Horatio Alger said similar things in his novels.The stories he tells are true but I'm unconvinced they are truths to bank on.

  I read the entire thing just to make sure I knew exactly how unfulfilling it truly was. There were maybe a few pages worth keeping in mind. The moral of the author's entire point is......sometimes people achieve success because of things that happened to them in life. Literally, go take the bus and have a conversation with any stranger and you'll find that to be more rewarding of an experience. I can't believe it has such an astounding reputation. I'm sorry for being harsh but there a better ways to spend your time than this reading book.

  Malcolm Gladwell's writing is simple and easy to comprehend but yet has such deep profound insights.  His books like Outliers take modern issues and he finds very simple solutions to them that were there just staring right at your face.  When Malcolm points out these solutions, you just hit your head and say why didn't I think of that?In Outliers Malcolm gives clear insights and answers as to what makes a tremendously successful person (Malcolm's definition of an Outlier).  In this book Outlier is only on the success side as the term Outlier can easily be used to define an abject loser also on the other end of the spectrum.  Now the simple synopsis of this book is that a successful Outlier is not a self made man only but also needs a few lucky circumstances, ethnicity, genetics, family background and breaks to become an Outlier.  After reading through Malcolm's tangible evidence, facts and anecdotes, I had to hit my head and say why didn't I ever come to these conclusions about successful people?  My perceptions on success and being successful have changed.

  There are few things more inspiring in American culture than the idea of the self-made man or woman. These are people who have seemingly risen from nothing to create immense success and, often, fortune for themselves. However, while success is certainly a measure of hard work, it’s a bit naïve to believe that simply working hard will result in an individual being successful. In his book Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell argues that, “Success is the result of what sociologists like to call ‘accumulative advantage’” (p. 30). In other words, what makes an individual an outlier, or someone so successful that they have been set apart from the majority of the population, is the culmination of hard work, opportunity, and a little bit of luck. Gladwell’s theories can be applied to modern education in startling ways. No one can control when they are born. However, given the nature of school starting at one specific point in the year, those who are born in the autumn have an immediate advantage over a child born in late spring or early summer. Why? Those who were born in the fall are close to six years of age when they begin kindergarten, while those born in the spring or summer have often just turned five years of age. This means that the September child would have an extra twelve months of learning, growing, experiencing the world, and maturing. Those students would more likely be placed into an accelerated or advanced program, where they would be challenged deeper than their younger counterparts. Over the course of thirteen years of schooling, the differences in academic instruction would really begin to add up.Reading this in the opening chapter was an epiphany for me. There is a big difference in maturity and learning between a one-year old and a two-year old. Yet, when students reach school age, we expect all of them to progress at the same rate from the same starting point when, in reality, the starting points are in different places, depending on when a student was born. The ability could be the same; however, because students are starting in different places, we quickly label them and sort them into categories from which it is hard to get out. Another aspect of Gladwell’s book that struck home is in regards to culture and socioeconomic status. Much is made in the media of the perceived failure of the American school system. However, Karl Alexander, a sociologist from Johns Hopkins University, found that students learn while they are in school. However, students from wealthier families learn when they’re not in school, through the forms of trips, lessons, and general life experiences. Those who are poorer do not have those experiences and therefore aren’t learning as much when school is not in session. The Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP) schools set up in New York City in the 1990s have proven that, if poorer students are given more time in the school day and less time outside of school, they score equally as well on standardized tests as their wealthier counterparts. If we as educators can find ways to help students learn while they are not in the classroom, we will help them be more successful. Gladwell is careful to point out that success must rely on hard work. Those who are given opportunities must seize them and be willing to put in the work to make those opportunities pay off. However, those who are given such opportunities are those who are in the right place at the right time. They are the students who are older or more mature, those who have the time and passion to put in the hard work, and those who continue learning when they are not in school. By understanding what factors result in success, we can better give our students the tools they need to allow those opportunities to come their way. I highly recommend this book to any educator; it opened my eyes to aspects of success that had previously not even entered my mind.

  I read this book, because it is on my daughter's summer reading list.  Some of those books have been very inspiring.  This is is one of them.  It's written well enough to read in a few days, but if there's time to stop and think about what the stories mean for our culture.  I gave it five stars, because he shows the reader how opportunities and cultural legacies of successful people have shaped their lives.  It illustrates for the reader how success is indeed attainable for those who take advantage of opportunities and are aware of how who they are influences the choices they make.  Some traits are helpful and some are not so helpful.  If an individual recognizes this, they can choose to behave differently in certain settings.  The stories also lead us to see how cultural traits influence education.  We can borrow some of these traits to help people in other cultures learn mathematics better and improve their lives.  I recommend this book for those who have just graduated as well.  Read the book!

  I really enjoyed this book . I think it helped more than most leadership books I have read.Most leadership books give you the ""be a cheerleader and all will be well"" kinda message. I felt this one helped me to A) take a deep breath and realize somethings are beyond my control B) sometimes no matter how hard you try- you will not be the next bill gates in your lifetime- because you missed the boom,not because you lack the skills. I was born in the 80's : too young to be a part of the computer birth, and investing in online companies (this is my humble opinion- others may/will disagree) too old to have grabbed the app craze. Just the right age to be killing it in the science world.I felt this book hit some interesting points. It is important to remember this book is his opinion and observations on soft science topics and NOT hard science. I read this as an interesting viewpoint and things that could be applied to my life with success ( example: there is a time and place for mitigated speech)I recommend it to people

  Being an outlier means being a non-conformist. One hears this kind of advice all the time. So many people buy into conventions that they forget the reasons behind the conventions.Gladwell seeks to critique the standard story of an outlier’s success. As normally told, outliers start doing there own thing; they work really hard and persevere; then in the end, they end up successful while all the world is envious of them; their story is one of individualism. Gladwell seeks to bring to light that while this may be true, there are social structures at work helping the person along.“No man [or woman] is an island,” wrote John Donne in the sixteenth century. Such is still true today, Gladwell admonishes us. We are the products of how our environments shape us. In order to succeed, we do not need to be different; instead, we need to grasp to make the most of the opportunities presented to us. He illustrates his point through telling interesting stories about topics as varied as hockey players’ birthdays, computer technology, slavery in Jamaica, and the interaction of ethnicity and plane crashes. These stories show what he means by the fact that we are all dependent on social supports to some degree. Success is not just a choice of the will; it is the product of a society.Some, particularly in America, might be defensive about their own individualism while reading Malcolm’s writing. We must be clear that Malcolm is not saying that individual choices and personality play no role. What he is saying is that society plays a role, too. We must pay attention to one’s culture and to plain luck as well.This book is an interesting read for leaders. It is not a sociological study and does not contain a depth of academic rigor. It seeks to inspire mainly by story and anecdote. It’s a good reminder to get our minds off of ourselves and our personalities and onto things that really help out the people next door, in the next cubicle, or in the next suburb or town.

  The debate of Nature versus Nurture is an old one. Hero culture, that idea of individual exceptionalism willed from “boot strap” beginnings, prevails heavily in the US. What this vision lacks is the detailed history and nuanced perspective on all of the circumstances that set up success in spite of all other factors.Malcolm Gladwell does another masterful job of diving into the complexities of social psychology; employing his usual story telling narrative style, along with data, and engaging anecdotes. Specifically, this book navigates through relatedness and definitions of IQ, EQ, and SQ. It builds from those foundations to ask how the odd formula of balancing those three along with “lucky” breaks help us see the true story behind success and failure.My individual perspective leads me to believe that who we are comes down to 1 part nature (IQ) plus 2 parts nurture (environment [EQ + SQ]). The bigger take away is that we have to really look at, what Gladwell calls the Cultural Heredity, of various scenarios to get to the root circumstances that filter people into successful, average, and failing buckets. Then ask ourselves, is the system itself producing outliers by way of some unseen flaw or is the playing field level and we are really seeing the cream of the crop?

  What an amazing book. For me the word outlier has a very mathematical meaning, being part of statistical analysis which I taught. It was interesting to see another dimension presented in the form of actual real life variables coming together to have profound affects on the lives of some very significant people. There were a couple of silly mistakes, like the ""220 000 kgs of STEEL slamming into the rocky ground"" whereby aluminum makes up 81% of the subject aircraft's primary structure (Boeing 747). I can relate to the struggle to rise up in social rank. My mother's family were Irish transplants from the potato famine of the mid 1800s on one side, and a runaway to sea from the island of Mauritius on the other. Overall the level of academic excellence in this book and the quality of intellectual thought makes it a worthy read.

  Malcom Gladwell’s Outliers is a fascinating book. It synthesizes the coincidental pathways that lead to greatness rather than common place, and does so on the individual level  all the way to the national and cultural levels with resulting ramifications. His thesis is not that everybody is bound for greatness, but more greatness could be achieved if the playing fields of education, sports, and culture could be leveled. This does not mean taking access away from achievers, but developing the means for equal access to pathways of greatness for more children/people.Gladwell lays his foundation with it really does matter when, where, and to whom you were born as well as avoiding apathy in pursuing the pathways of your choice. He explains how, in particular with a young child, it really is important in which month you were born in regard to physical and mental development, because depending on the grouping system, a child born at the end of the year, is in actuality a year younger than a peer child born at the beginning of the same year.It also matters to whom you were born, in what is a more novel look at the nature vs nurture debate. A high IQ means little to an individual who has no clear road to capitalize on his or her intelligence. Gladwell is not about making excuses, but identifying weaknesses in how we group and teach our young, and providing remedies for these weaknesses. Outliers was almost painful to read in this respect, as I looked back at my own childhood: born at the years end; last name towards the end of the alphabet, thus more often than not, sitting in the back of the classroom; in a class with 45-50 students; eyesight going bad, and nobody noticing until I had fallen behind in so many ways, including self confidence. It really enabled me to understand what happened, why it did, and finally developing the tools to reinvent myself when I was fortunate enough to take advantage of the opportunity for a “do over” in life.I would hope that those who have and will read Gladwell’s Outliers would see how they have benefitted, or not through the inconsistencies of our developmental systems. Yet, he correctly submits that it takes thousands of hours of work, as well as passion in what one does to be truly successful, all the while exposing that there are hidden advantages in life. When and where one is born, and being in the right place at the right time to capitalize on opportunity when offered does matter in regard to one’s success, or lack of success in life.

  3-3.5stars out of 5 stars. Gladwell sets his premise on the idea that “self-made” stars/high performers are less “self-made” and more a mix of hard work, many hours, and ethnic and cultural legacies. While he does bring up good considerations on how we view success, I feel some of his arguments fall short in their rigor. For example, he correlates work ethic to cultivate rice with Asian (actually mainly East Asian but he doesn’t make that distinction from most other Asian countries/cultures) but his attempts to turn it into a causation fall short despite his insistence that there is a causal relationship. If anything, many of his chapters feel so focused on ethnicity that they miss the stronger point about one’s environment. Since the initial release of this book (2008), there has been excellent discussion in 10,000 hour rule, grit, mastery, etc that bear consideration for the modern reader. His discussion on education focuses too much on time spent vs standardized test scores without touching on what benefits (social, soft skills, etc) are built outside the classroom. In terms of writing style, I felt that he was at times long winded before making his connections and don’t understand how others have called this book “explosively entertaining.” In term of book design, the paperback has a nice matte feel and comfortably pliable, creamy pages that open nicely and are easy on the eyes. The white book cover is nice until I accidentally pet my dogs dirty head and get noticeable smudges afterwards. Given all the rave reviews and how influential this book has purportedly been, I wasn’t expecting to feel so meh about it.

  I am a bit disappointed with this book. Yes, the examples of different successful people with their background like where they are coming from, their family, teachers, opportunities, the time they were lucky to be born on so on explains how they got where they got, BUT what about other people who weren’t so lucky to be born at the right time and in the right place (like Steve Jobs or Bill Gates 1995 or hockey players who were born mostly January to March who had the luck to make it in life understandably through hard work and tears of course) but who also had the very opportunities not like millions of others. What does this book offers for the regular people less lucky to be born in the right year or go to the best school or being able to read Shakespear at the age of 4? It is very repetitive with different stories of different successful people, that’s all. It goes same scenario other and other. Got to the half of the book and trying to hang on till the end of it, but from reading the names of the next chapters, the same routine is awaiting for me ahead which does not give me much motivation to finish it. I admit, the book does explain the hard work and passion people put into achieving their goals but I did not intend to buy the book to read people’s biographies. Seems like if you weren’t smart and special at the young age nothing special and great awaits for you in adulthood, just an ordinary life. Hmm does that sound inspiring? Not to me.PS: I learned about the 10.000 hours you have to put into certain carrier in order to master it well. Or why there is so many Jewish people in New York City who are lawyers or the reason why they own so many clothing companies. Also learned about why plains fall and how to grow great rice lol and about the easy and great linguistic structure Chinese people have which explains their way of easy learning and the way to a higher IQ.Too much going around the circle with these stories, wanted and expected much more of this book.

  Mark Twain once said ""there are three types of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics"" this book was written from a point of view that environments control everyone's destiny. Although I agree that environments have great influence on a majority of peoples lives, the author doesn't explorer all the ""true"" outliers that don't meet his hypothesis and ways those  individuals were capable of doing so beyond his 10,000 hour theory, which I agree. A final note: read this book with an open mind and understand that you can use to statistics the prove any hypothesis if you don't show all the data.

  I give it 5-stars for entertainment value and a 2-stars for reliability. My biggest problem with this book is that it heavily downplays the importance of intelligence, and this is to ""inspire"" readers. Gladwell makes a lot of assumptions and jumps to easy conclusions on topics that are frankly not that simple. For example, in one chapter he talks about how you only need to be ""smart enough"" (120 IQ) to have a shot at being the best at whatever you do. He cites a list of Nobel Prize winners and the Universities they graduated from--claiming that graduates from schools like Holy Cross and Georgetown have Nobel Laureates too, and not all Prize winners are from Harvard or MIT as we may stereotypically believe. This is a fallacious assumption as IQ does not perfectly correlate with one's alma mater, and ironically, Gladwell does not account for the outliers that exist within every single school. People go to different universities for a variety reasons, one primarily being economic cost and another being the proximity to the parents' or family's home. For example, even if you're the brightest, most accomplished high schooler in all of America, chances are, you might go to Holy Cross over Harvard if you happen to live closer to Holy Cross and the aforementioned school offered you a full scholarship. Gladwell should have just listed the IQ numbers of the Nobel Laureates to avoid the extra layer of ambiguity. Also, the way the author presents his arguments, about how IQ is not as important as the knowledge of being able to communicate with and persuade people, neglects the complexity of IQ based intelligence. For example, a Nobel laureate may have a 120 (non-genius) IQ, but what if s/he were tested in the domain of his specific speciality? Would a world-class architect with ""only"" an IQ of 120, for example, score ""only"" a 120 on spatial intelligence? I doubt it. I hypothesize that if you break down people's ""intelligences,"" most experts will tend to excel at the specific domain that is needed in their specialities, even if their IQ's were normal overall.There are many other examples of hasty generalizations in ""Outliers,"" but the most critical one I would like to make is on the chapter about how Asians are hard working and good at Math because they are descended from generations of meticulous rice farmers from China and because East Asians have historically developed a more logical way of representing numbers linguistically. The book goes as far as to casually include a footnote citing one researcher who believes Asians actually have a lower IQ than whites, and that they happen to be good at math despite having a lower IQ. This is a subtly ethnocentric view based on bad data, thrown in casually in the mix with other data, as if all claims were undeniable facts by association. As a South Korean American who has grown up with a group of other East Asians students throughout high school and college, I can testify that yes, East Asians do tend to excel at Math more than any other demographic. Note, these are Asian AMERICANS that are excelling. We have absolutely nothing to do with Rice paddies. Some of us are sons and daughters of parents that don't even speak the native asian languages they came from. And many others of us have never even visited our home countries or learned a culture outside of that which is American. Now, me personally, I have lived in both Korea and America, but that doesn't make Gladwell's argument any more relevant to me. While growing up in America, I had to learn how to count in two different languages simultaneously, and it actually took me much longer to learn how to count than most of my other caucasian peers. I still excelled once I got to middle and high school. I still scored near perfect scores on standardized math tests, even though I eventually counted and thought about numbers primarily in English like everyone else. I worked hard, but it has nothing to do with the rice paddies. Neither my parents, nor my grandparents, nor my great-grandparents, nor my great-great-grandparents were rice farmers (I have no record of family beyond that). And neither were most of my friends' families. Such a cultural association is meaningless to me and my Asian friends. In fact, I laughed when I read that chapter. I can only imagine that 20-years from now (hopefully less), this book will be in a buzzfeed article as a laughable, antiquated example of how an author could generalize an entire race of people. To be clear, I don't object the author's attempt at citing a positive attribute of a race, my race, but he fails to rise above making stereotypical assumptions that so pervades American culture. Overall, the author's assumptions are naive and lacking in critical analysis. I encourage you to read this with a skeptical mind--think about the data you're being presented with. The best examples in this book are untestable anecdotes, i.e., non-scientific. Most of the resources cited in the back of the book are outdated or in need of more research to validate the claims.Now, I don't want to deny the impact of culture. I just think that the book makes incorrect associations. For example, I think my East Asian friends and I are good at math, not because we were raised in rice-paddies or because we could count in an Asian language more efficiently, but rather because our parents taught us the fundamentals rather clearly from a young age. In addition, I believe I did well at math because even though I had to juggle learning two languages while growing up--English and Korean--I actually treated math like a third language. The numbers were a different entity, and thus I never really translated the numbers into meaning. There was no intellectual ""middle-man"" so to speak, and I feel that this was the key for my fluency in mathematics.I normally don't write reviews on Amazon, but as an Asian American, I really wanted to set the record straight and demystify any stereotypical assumptions the reader may have formed after reading this book. Question everything you read! Don't be a lemming!

  “Outliers: The Story of Success,” by Malcolm Gladwell, is a highly engaging book that explores how people are able to surpass the average standard of success, and how they have come to reach that point.  Gladwell organizes the book in two parts and dedicating each chapter to a particular person, theory, or story. He combines cultural context, psychology and physiology, and the timeliness of opportunity to rationalize what creates success. Gladwell packs each chapter with data, statistics, and specific examples to support all his claims, and the data gathered is interesting to review when reading. He does a great job of linking events and stories together to show that success is based on more than just natural talents. The theories talked about in the chapters were insightful, and offered new understandings of what creates success. Although Gladwell tends to ramble, the book was incredibly thought-provoking, and lead to many deep and interesting conversations between myself and others who were reading it. If you’re willing to really analyze the content, it could definitely leave an impact on your life. I recommend this book to anyone who is curious and enjoys reading material that challenges them to think critically.

  I always enjoy reading Malcolm Gladwell's books. The primary content is colorful anecdotes used to glue together intellectual concepts and theories. Often, I'm either not familiar with Malcolm's concept, or I see it in a new light after reading. The insights are practical, and I can see their application in real life. My Mom suggested these books when I was younger, but I was not interested enough. I'm glad that I'm open to this influence now. I read 'Blink' in two chunks. The first was in high school when despite being obsessed with chess and virtually disinterested in everything else, I picked up 'Outliers' and easily concentrated for some 100-ish pages in a row. It was just that good. Later, I resumed and easily finished it. Rather than summarize this book, I'll reiterate that 'Blink' is entertaining, instructive, and easy to read for the layman. Highly recommended.

  This is a book that serves multiple purposes in my view. First and foremost, it gives you an idea of how to think about things in a different context - that is probably as important or even more important than many other aspects, namely the importances of coincidence, setup and the system one is within to judge the results.Eg.: the opening story about succesful ice hockey players being born within a certain range of months not only intuitively immediately makes sense, but also affected my view on how to tackle upcoming questions in my own life (school education for children and the likes).Given the understandable and relatable concepts, this book or its contents is also a great dinner conversation opener - at least i enjoyed it that way too - and a lot of people went out there right away and bought the book following those discussions ;-)Last, it also serves a bit as an anchor in your own life as it teaches you some lessons on what success is also about. Yes, you have to be good at what you do, but there is also a multitude of other factors that all have to play together. This is not supposed to sound like a way to find excuses, but more as a guideline of what it is, that will make it easier to become successful.A truly enjoyable read as well.

  The premise of Mr Gladwell's book is that great achievement is partially determined by when are where you were born. This in itself will come as no surprise but the author succeeds in making a science of it. For example, if you wanted to be part of the computer revolution, 1955 USA was the best time and place to be born. All the major founders of Apple and  Microsoft were born between 1953-1957 with Bill Gates and Steve Jobs both born perfectly in 1955. That is not the only example but I have read other books of this author and this is another fascinating read. Highly recommend.

  Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers is an exceptional book about exceptions.  The book goes through many different case stories talking about many different types of exceptions -- ie exceptional individuals such as Bill Gates and other early computer pioneers, exceptional events such as plane crashes, exceptional communities such as the town in Pennsylvania with great longevity, and even exceptional populations such as Asians and their achievement in math. It discusses all of these exceptions as not products of innate biological difference between people but as contingent facts to do with how individuals dealt with the opportunities presented to them and how culture shaped this dealing with the opportunity.The book also talks about how very specific events such as the birth date cut off for admission into hockey leagues, like a butterfly's wings flapping, has long lasting effects on people's destinies and trajectories.  There is the anomaly that professional hockey players tend to be all born early in the year, in January and February and not at the end of the year.  Likewise, many of the great billionaires of both this gilded age and the previous one in the early nineteenth century were born nearly at the same year reflecting the fact that they just were at the right moment for the cutoff to take advantage of certain opportunities.  One comes away from the book feeling not that it is inevitable that men of Bill Gates' and Steve Jobs' stature would naturally become titans of the computer industry but rather that they reflected special contingencies.  One wonders how applicable the logic is to the new generation -- i.e. Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg .  Do they benefit the same way?The book also describes ""young genius programs"" such as that developed by Terman at Stanford, ostensibly based purely on innate abilities, and how ""relatively"" unsuccessful these people were in real life, being in a sense surpassed by those taking better advantage of their context.Finally, the book tackles an exceptional population. It analyzes the amazing proficiency of Asians for mathematics, looking at how this may relate to their cultural proclivity for hard work through rice farming and also some aspects of their language, which deals with numbers in a much more uniform way than the irregular forms of English.Overall a great read that gives one an exceptional view of the exceptional.

  I want this quote from Chapter 8 tattooed on my students’ foreheads: “Success is a function of persistence and doggedness and the willingness to work hard for twenty-two minutes to make sense of something that most people would give up on after thirty seconds.” Nailed it. No better statement explains the difference between success and failure in my English and writing classes.Part of me really enjoyed reading this book, though as many reviewers have pointed out, the parts are greater individually than as a whole. The most interesting and insightful chapter is right up front, Gladwell’s analysis of Little League hockey (quite fascinating). The other stories, about such topics as pilots, rice paddies and summer school, while interesting and well written, ultimately drew what I thought were pretty obvious conclusions: clear, blunt communication in times of peril is good, having a hard work ethic is good, and putting that work ethic into practice is even better. Um. Duh?Each chapter’s new idea is thoughtful and well explained, but when I finished the book, I didn’t feel the earth-shattering revelations that I was hoping for. Instead, I sat back and thought to myself, I’m not sure I just learned anything that I didn’t already know. In fact, I thought to myself, Who doesn’t already know on some level what Outliers purports, that sweeping success is a matter of heritage, luck, skill and hard work.Now that I think about it, it’s almost insulting that Gladwell assumes most Americans believe that success is purely a matter of skill or hard work, that greats such as Albert Einstein and Bill Gates succeeded as a result of their innate genius and astounding IQ alone. But then my brain reminds me, Hey, you teach high school, and students act on this flawed premise all the time. And if the kids do, what does that say about the parents? Might they also underestimate the value of persistence, hard work, and opportunity? (The answer, BTW, is that yes, there are tons of parents who understand that hard work is good for their student, but who don’t understand exactly what “hard work” means for the academic setting.)Thinking back to my students again, and about how easily they give up, and how little effort they’re willing to put into their own education, suddenly a book like this makes perfect sense. This is why Outliers: Chapters 1 and 2 are going to be making their debut in my freshman classroom this year. Perhaps the real lesson of Outliers is not the conclusions that it draws, but the fact that few of us actually put these conclusions to practical use. And in that sense, this is a very valuable book indeed

  The point on the age and birth month in regards to childhood sports program is valid.The hypothesis on ""x"" number of hours to become the Beatles or Bill Gates do not hold water.Sure the Beatles, Bill Gates, Arnold, Schoenberg, Claude Debussy and others polished their minds by putting in the time but lots of people put in that much and more time. Time does not account for creativity and original thought and true genius going from DOS to windows or developing a new musical system or the impressionistic movement in Music is not a function of time. Emanuel Kant's ""Critique of Aesthetics"" speaks at a real genius level to what an original thought and creating is. Of course not very many people have or ever will even come near Kant's level of genius.

  Not gonna lie, I had really high expectations for this book because it was highly recommended from all the reviews that I had read and from several friends that also told me it was very good. I was interested mainly because I thought it would be a self help/improvement book that had advice to apply to daily life, but instead I felt like each chapter was more of just providing factual stories and then having a conclusion at the end that I feel like were common sense or I already had learned through my own experiences from the past. The first few chapters were somewhat intriguing with the real life examples of successful people but then halfway through the book I already lost interest and was pretty disappointed in the content. I got pretty bored and finished the book just to finish it, not really because I wanted to.

  As someone whose work is in the field of academic psychology, Gladwell's heavy reliance on anecdotes to support his theories was frustrating. However, I can certainly respect his ability to find connections where others have not and to follow through with writing up his findings in a compelling way. Taken as interesting stories about successful people, I can appreciate this book. However, from the perspective of a researcher in psychology who prefers to rely on appropriately powered studies and solid statistical analyses to learn about the conditions under which people excel, I'm not crazy about it.

  Great book - gave it to two relatives as a gift.  I especially like the chapter on how the sewing skills Jewish immigrants brought with them in the 19th century led to being their economic springboard, rising economically above other immigrant groups of the time, and making New York City the global center of textile manufacturing in 1890.It brings many famous ""geniuses"" and moguls down-to-earth by showing how their biographies effected their life's work and led them to success, starting in childhood. For example, Bill Gates went to a fancy private school, and was one of the first students in the U.S. to learn rudimentary programming at the age of 12.

  The author is easy to read.  He divides the book into groups of factually similar individual stories that, in turn, cluster around a common theme.  Overall the point is that people who have succeeded to the point that they can be called ""outliers"" did not achieve their success alone.  In many instances the luck of their birth date provided the crucial first step ahead and in some the culture in which they were born proved to be the extra impetus needed to get ahead and stay there.  The book is an understated argument that raw talent is distributed evenly and that society would benefit if the opportunity for development was equally distributed.

  Wow, anyone who teaches or is in business should read this book. It opens your eyes as to demographics and why some people succeed and others fail. For example, the National Hockey League is full of January through March birthdays because the cut off date is typically January 1st for youth leagues.  The older kids have a huge advantage, almost a year older when they start playing at 4 or 5.  Plus, once they get going at that age, the older kids make higher levels (traveling teams), thus better coaching and more ice time.  This applies to school, other sports, and other facets of life.

  In Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell explores how hidden advantages and opportunities play a role for people who've achieved extraordinary success. He looks at how cultural legacies shape the patterns of our behavior and that when and where you are born matters.Using stories and statistics, Gladwell talks about how intelligence, socioeconomics, and the power distance index (our attitudes toward hierarchy) play a role in achieving extraordinary success.I found this to be an important, interesting, and thought-provoking book.

  Although Malcolm's writing can often become repetitive, I cannot see myself giving Outliers anything less than 5 stars. Although business-inclined folk might see this as a challenge to their tenets (hard work and talent = success), to me, it felt invigorating. It showed me that the meaning of success has been smeared and misunderstood, while Gladwell argued for a redefinition. Do not fear, business people. This book won't tell you that success is basically luck and that your hard work will be for nothing. It will tell you, though, that you must be able to recognize your environment for what it is, and how you can make it work. It will tell you that the road to success is convoluted and sometimes hidden in plain sight. To me, it showed me that to be an Outlier, you have to keep your head up, practice constantly, and be able to recognize opportunities and seize them.

  Another great book by Malcolm Gladwell. If you like his other books this one will not disappoint. Gladwell explains why some people achieve great success while some other, equally gifted and hardworking people do not. Gladwell posits that success is based on a unique set of circumstances that are outside of the successful person's control and then does a pretty good job of proving his point. While he never dismisses the factors of effort, talent and hard work, he does put these in perspective and the context of unique opportunity. In a very personal and interesting conclusion, Gladwell fits the theory to his own family and his own success.I am a fan - I think the author is an awesome storyteller. His skill in presenting complex scientific principals in an entertaining and easy to understand format is truly a gift.

  The main premise of the book, as outlined by Malcom is: ""In Outliers, I want to convince you that these kinds of personal explanations of success don't work. People don't rise from nothing. We do owe something to parentage and patronage. The people who stand before kings may look like they did it all by themselves. But in fact they are invariably the beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies that allow them to learn and work hard and make sense of the world in ways others cannot. It makes a difference where and when we grew up. The culture we belong to and the legacies passed down by our forebears shape the patterns of our achievement in ways we cannot begin to imagine. It's not enough to ask what successful people are like, in other words. It is mainly by asking where they dire from that we can unravel the logic behind who succeeds and who doesn't.""Below are key excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:1- ""Wolf and Bruhn had to convince the medical establishment to think about health and heart attacks in an entirely new way: they had to get them to realize that they wouldn't be able to understand why someone was healthy if all they did was think about an individual's personal choices or actions in isolation. They had to look beyond the individual. They had to understand the culture he or she was a part of, and who their friends and families were, and what town their families came from. They had to appreciate the idea that the values of the world we inhabit and the people we surround ourselves with have a profound effect on who we are. In Outliers I want to do for our understanding of success what Stewart Wolf did for our understanding of health.""2- ""Their research suggests that once a musician has enough ability to get into a top music school, the thing that distinguishes one performer from another is how hard he or she works. That's it. And what's more, the people at the very top don't work just harder or even much harder than everyone else. They work much, much harder.""3- ""We pretend that success is exclusively a matter of individual merit. But there's nothing in any of the histories we've looked at so far to suggest things are that simple. These are stories, instead, about people who were given a special opportunity to work really hard and seized it, and who happened to come of age at a time when that extraordinary effort was rewarded by the rest of society. Their success was not just of their own making. It was a product of the world in which they grew up.""4- ""The relationship between success and IQ works only up to a point. Once someone has reached an IQ of somewhere around 120, having additional IQ points doesn't seem to translate into any measurable real-world advantage.""5- ""Those three things--autonomy, complexity, and a connection between effort and reward--are, most people agree, the three qualities that work has to have if it is to be satisfying...Work that fulfills those three criteria is meaningful.""6- ""So far in Outliers we've seen that success arises out of the steady accumulation of advantages: when and where you are born, what your parents did tor a living, and what the circumstances of your upbringing were all make a significant difference in how well you do in the world. The question for the second part of Outliers is whether the traditions and attitudes we inherit from our forebears can play the same role. Can we learn something about why people succeed and how to make people better at what they do by taking cultural legacies seriously? 1 think we can.""7- ""Each of us has his or her own distinct personality. But overlaid on top of that are tendencies and assumptions and reflexes handed down to us by the history of the community we grew up in, and those differences are extraordinarily specific.""8- ""The lesson here is very simple. But it is striking how ten it is overlooked. We are so caught in the myths ot the best and the brightest and the self-made that we think outliers spring naturally from the earth. We look at the young Bill Gates and marvel that our world allowed that thirteen-year-old to become a fabulously successful entrepreneur. But that's the wrong lesson. Our world only allowed one thirteen-year-old unlimited access to a timesharing terminal in 1968. If a million teenagers had been given the same opportunity, how many more Microsofts would we have today? To build a better world we need to replace the patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages that today determine success--the fortunate birth dates and the happy accidents of history--with a society that provides opportunities for all.""9- ""Superstar lawyers and math whizzes and software entrepreneurs appear at first blush to lie outside ordinary experience. But they don't. They are products of history and community, of opportunity and legacy. Their success is not exceptional or mysterious. It is grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky--but all critical to making them who they are. The outlier, in the end, is not an outlier at all.""

  Always historicize is a dictum espoused by Fredric Jameson and other cultural critics when it comes to understanding phenomena. Malcolm Gladwell here adds to the materiality of success as a phenomenon that is essentially not abnormal or irrational—the oddity of success can be historically explained if we keenly study the opportunities made available to a seeming outlier. Brilliant message that has the ring of truth in spite of any perceived rhetorical weakness or sub-scholarly merit some critics are quick to point out. Gladwell’s seeming unwillingness to do the academic dance expected of scholars is refreshing: He’s a popular cultural critic who seems to want to make academic inquiry and discovery a layman pursuit.

  I read this book over the course of several weeks and found it engaging and entertaining - very anecdote heavy. Does not delve deep into scientific/research theories of success, with exception of Hofstede's cultural elements, which tbh are pretty widely known already. Toward the end, the author waxes eloquent explaining why the cultural values springing from Chinese farming are very much superior to the values springing from ""Western"" style farming. I understand what he's getting at, and it holds water to some extent. But the whole point of the book is to explain outliers - people who are extroadinarily successful, particularly in business. Frankly, in modern history the percentage of outliers (richest, most influential people worldwide) coming from China is significantly lower than the percentage of outliers coming from the US. Chinese students score significantly higher on tests than US students, particularly in math - but does that make them outliers?Ultimately, the book's main flaw is its lack of actionable takeways. I came away with a slight motivational ""buzz"" which I often experience after reading anecedote-rich self-help literature. I think I also understand the need for educational reform in the US on a deeper level. I'll also be more empathetic toward those who are not successful, for much is out of their control; and not worship those who achieve success, for they owe much to ""lucky breaks"" and their family/culture/educational environments.But ultimately, what steps should I take to become an outlier? How can I become the next Bill Gates or Barak Obama? . . .this book didn't really say

  Outliers is one of those books that, on the outset, seemed very drab, as I almost immediately read through statistics and tables. However, as I read on, I became more and more immersed in the book, relishing the amount of evidence he has given for each of his claims. He tells us the in depth stories of Bill Gates, Bill Joy, the Beatles, and more in an attempt to find the combination of advantages that these people enjoyed and made these people successful. At first, his claims are a little outlandish; what connection do rice fields and Asians being good at math have? After reading through all of his logic, however, I now ask myself why I didn't think in this manner before! This book is a rare and good read because the author very clearly explains the problem(s) in the way society generally looks at success, an corrects it, in detail. Doing so, he makes learn, introspect, and change your own thoughts on success according to the evidence given. I sincerely believe that each person should read Outliers as they enter high school or college, as they are pivotal stages in their lives; after reading this, they would recognize the different aspects in their own lives that could make them successful and exploit them. Here's a good rule of thumb about Outliers: if you are even vaguely interested in reading this book, you should definitely give it a go!

  Have you ever wondered what takes to become the “World’s Greatest” at something? What it takes to go from rags to riches? How much talent or determination you need? In Malcolm Gladwell’s book Outliers, Gladwell addresses those very questions. Many people think that success derives from talent and determination, but Gladwell disputes that success doesn’t completely rely on those factors. Prior to reading the book, I heard that it would be very factual and is backed up with numbers and statistics. It didn’t seem like I was going to be as interested as I ended up being. Each chapter Gladwell tackles a different topic which supports his claim about success, and it kept me flipping the page to see what new evidence he would bring up in the next chapter. With each success story, Gladwell synthesises the evidence well to the overall picture so you don’t get confused and to understand the correlation to the bigger picture. The chapter about the correlation between cultural background and plane crashes was a chapter that surprised me the most, and I would get the reaction a lot when he would connect his points and you could understand what all the facts meant together. In conclusion, Gladwell’s ability to combine mundane facts into a brilliant work of literature opened my mind to a whole new genre. I think anyone that reads this book will learn something from it and will have their eyes opened to a whole new perspective that was never seen before.

  Outliers is an exceptional examination of society as a whole - the narratives and stories we tell ourselves to identify why some in society and others have-not. The simple explanation is totally obvious and not what we would have instinctively thought. Success has nothing to do with talent, it has everything to do with the built-in advantages society, family, community, cultures give that person to make them who they are.Great read!!!!!

  Malcolm argues that success is not achieved by extraordinary individuals that set out to achieve it out of pure desire. Instead, extremely successful stories are derived from a compound set of events that play out over a long period of time (sometimes it takes generations) and is maximized by the individuals to harvest the potential of what was put in front of them.It has been a long time that I've been wanting to read a book from Mr. Gladwell and I am glad I did.

  The blurb for the book says, ""In this stunning new book, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of ""outliers"".""'Stunning' isn't the word I would have picked, unless an ox is somehow involved. The guy's a good writer. But an interview I saw (Colbert) confirmed my suspicion that he takes huge enjoyment in jerking us around.Of course, maybe I'm just jealous that 'tipping point' is on the lips of every brain-dead commentator. A simple idea, straight out of Statistics 1, surrounded by 200 pages of breathless hyperbole. Outliers seems to follow that model.So, OK, I get it. Canadian hockey players excel because ... Wait a minute, they're not outliers at all ... they're members of a small, well-defined group. And all that business of why the Beatles got 'so good' Hours and hours of playing?? The songs had nothing to do with it right? Isaac Stern got good at playing the fiddle by hours and hours of practice, but anyone that's picked up an instrument knows that it takes practice, a lot of talent, and some soul to play well.Oh well, presumably Gladwell will continue quite successfully to blow warm wind, with a whiff of science, up our skirts.

  Fun, insightful nugs of knowledge, wisdom, and not-so-common sense wrapped up in phenomenal storytelling.This book struck home in a few ways. First, the genius thing (I scored in the 99.99th percentile as a kid) and I've known for a while now that it takes a hell of a lot more than smarts to cut it in this world. Thankfully, I had my upper lower class mom (who all had a thing for bikers) to teach me social savvy. Second, parenting styles (engaged or not engaged) and how that tends to be split along class divisions and what a massive difference that makes in sustained performance and success. Third, and this one was a massive eye-opener, was the culture of honor I myself adopted from my mom's side - generations removed from the source - and the good and bad of that legacy. We are Scotch-Irish and are fiercely everything. I've already ordered Albion's Seed to learn more.Gladwell writes this book how books should be written - well thought, organized, and researched with good information not easily found elsewhere, tied together with sincerity and a skill for storytelling that pulls it all together and makes it so relateable you almost forget to learn from it. That's the bow on top.

  Great read! It shared stuff I've not thought about before.

It looked at this from a few angles, & only complaint was that it felt like it could offer more.

  I have to come back and review this book after reading it a few years ago.My professor made me read this book in community college. My previous education (high school, middle, elementary) was not the greatest. I grew up with many discouraging teachers who assured myself and my classmates we wouldn't amount to much so there's no real point in trying. When my professor gave me this book I laughed. There was no way in hell a book was going to explain to me how success works. Because at this point, I was convinced it was impossible.This book changed my perspective on not just my education, but my goals, and how I viewed my past. The system screws over so many students. And it's not just a problem in the USA, but all over the world. Sure, some success in this book is luck or timing with a few other elements. (Bill Gates, Steve Jobs) But chapters like ""The 10,000 Hour Rule"" are incredibly thought provoking and are lessons I often think about on  a regular basis. It's been a few years and I turned my life around a lot with my education and now my career. I like to think a lot of that began after reading this book. I wish I had read this in high school. If you're a teach or professor, I highly recommend making your students read this like my professor did to me.

  This book reads more like trying to form some pattern within a collection of anectodes. The various stories make this book an interesting read, but somehow the explicit  link to outliers is not found in some of them.Some of the facts are quite mundane, like hardwork on moderate intelligence  can trump an idle high intelligence.  And that the timing of ones effort determines the success quite often. How many times have we heard that of some great ideas failing just because it was a bit ahead of its times. So, it is not surprising that as opportune time arrives, there would be some entrepreneur who will gain the insight to create a great business.  This book misses how the legendary businessmen (Bill Gates Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg)  could gain acute insights, although there is a small mention of the garments.And yes, inherited wealth grows much faster than new wealth, Thomas Piketty has elaborated that in detail in his book.The part of pilots and air crashes was passably interesting (though not fully correct), but the connect to outlier was missing.  Yes, its a well known fact that in most of the Asian tradition, seniority is sacrosanct, but it has impact on almost all businesses (and many scams), not only airlines.So, overall i am a bit disappointed with this book, especially when compared to other works of Malcolm.

  I have no idea whether someone did such kind of review or not, but I am going to write an solution of a puzzle. This is for those who enjoy puzzles and seek an solution in reviews. In chapter 3, The Trouble With Geniuses, Part 1, at third part, about 23% of the entire book, second picture is a puzzle that tests one's intelligent level, and the author failed to provide the method to the answer. Start from the top left corner of the puzzle and notice the heart shapes, they all exist in three vertical lines. Then, to its right and to its down, notice the diamond shapes in those two pictures, they too are placed in all three vertical lines, and the rest merely has two. Again, observe the slant line from top right to bottom left and notice the club shapes, they are in three vertical lines, and the remain only have two. Do you see the pattern? At the middle left and middle bottom, we are back to heart shapes. So, one thing that we can be sure about the last one is that there are three club shapes exist in three vertical lines, which leaves option A, F, and C. Finally, the hearts and diamonds only occur in two vertical lines not three, therefore, the option A fits the requirements and is the answer.

  Great book by Malcom Gladwell.  A point-by-point summary:PROS- good for those who like a scientific or external third-party reference.  It is important to have this as an author because it demonstrates validity by having multiple proofs of what a person is claiming.- easy to read: not overly heavy with scientific jargon- interesting scenarios/situations: by changing the focus from Canadian hockey teams to immigrant towns and health issues followed with mathematic skills in eastern and western cultures, it keeps the reader very engaged.- available in paperback.  I remember when it first came out, it was only in hardback and that was disappointing because not only is it more expensive, it is also heavy.CONS- can be a bit heavy (but not heavy like a scientific journal article) if someone is expecting this to be more ""lighter"" reading.  Other ""success"" (but more motivational rather than inflective) books would be something like Scott Adams ""How to  Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big."".

  If you read a lot of self-help books, Outliers puts the icing on the cake. It reinforces the fact that the most gifted people literally had time, sources of opportunity, used their abilities to negotiate for what they need, and literally took advantage of the number of hours in a day to get ahead. Bill Gates had all this, the point is even if he was just gifted, he needed all of the above to get where he is right now. He might not have Microsoft if he didn't have all these opportunities. The thing I took from this book is that we all have opportunities, we just have to realize the things we have under our control, we can make use of, and we absolutely HAVE to be aware of so we can take advantage, no matter how underpriveledged or poor we might be. Even if our culture we grew up with sets us back (spoiler: Korean airline story), we can always learn to get over our past cultural standards to work better with others, or even use our cultural ways to apply to other areas in life (another spoiler: rice paddy work ethic and business-minded planting). Great book imo.

  Malcolm Gladwell's genius is to write interestingly about complex ideas and show their relevance to us.I am using Outliers as a required textbook in my college English classes because Gladwell is a model of good writing. Students may be somewhat interested in that characteristic, but their thoughtful responses in Discussion groups (I am teaching online) reveals their interest has been captured by the ideas Gladwell presents.

  This is an amazing book for anyone in business. No matter your position, whether you are a CEO or an intern this book helps you develop the mindset of how to be an effective businessman or woman.  The book is broken up into section or parts that allow you to focus on one concept at a time and truly ingest all of the information being passed. In part one Gladwell takes the time to describe how opportunities are very important. He relates opportunity to timing in a way that acts as a function of time. The author notes how the timing of the birth of notable people such as Bill Gates provided a great opportunity that would not have been available to me being born years later. I especially enjoyed when the author talks about 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert. This was very intriguing to me because I believe that some people mistake luck for expertise.  As an entrepreneur, this book is a fundamental tool in forming the proper mindset to achieve success. The concepts outlined in Outliers are not new but have a rather new feel and relevance to them that will definitely help you grow as an entrepreneur. I am student at the University of Baltimore and I was assigned this book as a required reading. Luckily I had already read this twice before, but I still enjoyed the read. It’s always refreshing to review the information presented in this book. If you haven’t already, add this text to your library.

  I first discovered Malcolm Gladwell through his podcast, Revisionist History because I, too, at that time was thinking about doing a podcast to tell my stories.  And while I was not the one to buy the book and my husband not listening to podcasts, I would speaking highly of Mr. Gladwell.  My husband the. Took his Master Class online and then bought this book.Since my father was sent to Taiwan (very long and dysfunctional story 😆) I made a promise to myself that I will use an array of means to tell my story!  This book and his writing style has made me aware of what and how I want to tell my stories.  And I will take his Master Class when my family drama settles.  For now I’m just incubating all these simply written and interesting stories!Thank you Malcolm Gladwell for sharing your stories to us!

  Outliers is a book about successors. Malcolm Gladwell analyzes success follows a predictable course. Success is a gift, he asserts, not simply the sum of the decisions and efforts we make on our own behalf, nor given to the brightest. Outliers are who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize opportunities given to them. From this perspective, Matthew’s words, “For unto everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance. But from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath,” makes sense to us. Success is the result of accumulative advantage. Past successors were born at the right time with the right parents and the right ethnicity. Gladwell claims we need to replace the patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages that today determine success, the fortunate birth dates and the happy accidents of history, with a society that provides opportunities for all to build a better world.Gladwell verifies existence of skewed birth months among pro sports players. He, then, inspects the 10,000-hour rule for success, and concludes the brain takes 10,000 hours to assimilate all that it needs to know to achieve true mastery. Success, he says, is a function of persistence and doggedness and the willingness to work hard. Not all geniuses grab success during their lifetimes. Almost none of the genius children from the lower social and economic class ended up making a name for themselves. He stresses the importance of practical intelligence, which helps you read situations correctly and get what you want, like knowing what to say to whom, knowing when to say it, and knowing how to say it for maximum effect. We get these kinds of attitudes and skills from our families. Middle-class parenting style, “concerted cultivation,” attempts to actively foster and assess a child’s talents, opinions and skills, while poor parents tending to follow a strategy of accomplishment of natural growth, by contrast, letting them grow and develop on their own.Gladwell illustrates constraints of cultural legacy by an example of “Scotch-Irish” and past plane crushes. Success arises out of the steady accumulation of advantages. When and where we are born, what our parents do for a living, and what the circumstances of our upbringing are make a significant difference in how well we do in the world. Cultural legacy, the traditions and attitudes we inherit from our forebears, can play the same role. Community around us prepares us properly for the world. We are handed down tendencies and assumptions and reflexes by the history of the community we grew up in. He shows us the Power Distance Index differs greatly among cultures. Also he points out the exact opposite communication styles between the East and the West. Western communication has a transmitter orientation, while many Asian countries are receiver oriented. Working really hard is what successful people do. He finds a clear relationship in rice farming between effort and reward. Autonomy, complexity, and connection between effort and reward are what work has to have if it is to be satisfying. The genius of the culture formed in the rice paddies is that hard work gave those in the fields a way to find meaning in the midst of great uncertainty and poverty. Outliers are also those people who are given the opportunity to escape the constraints of their cultural legacy.Gladwell’s suggestion to make up classes with school kids of similar birth dates is worth to consider.

  I first heard about this book when Chris Rock referred to it on The Howard Stern Show. When Stern asked Rock what it took to be a great standup comic Rock replied, ""ten thousand mother f***ing hours.""  Stern got the reference right away, saying ""Malcolm Gladwell right?"" and Chris Rock said, ""it's my bible.""  I downloaded this to my kindle before the interview was over.I loved Gladwell's stories and how he so neatly explains that success is not just a product of innate ability or just hard work. There is some luck involved and it's something we not only have to acknowledge but it can open our mind to how we can create more opportunities for ourselves and for others. And I agree that it takes 10,000 hours to master just about anything. I've felt it in my own career and seen it in others. Are you willing to do the work?  Put in the time?  Gladwell calls it your ""Hamburg"" (after showing how The Beatles became a force to be reckoned with after their stints in Hamburg). To be a true success he believes, and I would agree, that you have to log those hours, put in that time, refuse to take short cuts and understand that the only way to get from here to there is relentless Hard Work.

  There is little doubt that Malcolm Gladwell is an engaging story teller, clearly a result of his his background as a journalist. His style is both easy to read and informative. The individuals whose lives and stories he uses to illustrate his points are at once interesting and at the same time well chosen to illuminate the issues under his social microscope. These are stories told with enough detail, often gleaned from personal interviews with the people at whom he chooses to look in intimate detail. He avoids in large measure the narrow vision that such inspection may yield by also investigating the social sciences that have searched out the details of such difficult concepts. Everyone has some idea who ""makes it"" and who does not. That is often easy to see because life rewards those who make great effort in general. The difficult part is understanding why some succeed so well and others who may be even more gifted do not, at least in terms of the world's way of rewarding the star performers. It is often the grist of of rumor and innuendo as to why or how some people make it to the top of the ""food chain."" But to analyze the reasons carefully and then apply the scientific data of real studies to those stories brings this clearly into the realm of reality, if we ever really know that that is. As one who has spent a lifetime trying to apply the results of scientific study to the real world I found his approach noteworthy because of its practical applicability. I have read many dry textbooks, articles and studies and sometimes had difficulty seeing their real world application. But these stories are very illustrative of the points Mr. Gladwell is attempting to help us see with clarity.I enjoyed very much reading this work and wondering if it would have made some difference in the way I lived my own life and what I may have accomplished had I applied the message of its pages. I think that this can help everyone with ambition and ability to achieve more and those who may not have as much of a gift do well with what they have inasmuch as he clearly points out that achievement of greatness is often the result of great effort and application of what natural ability one has. I liked the ""10,000 hours"" as a real world application of what it takes to do it well.There is just enough science to give the work credibility, but not make it dry or over the heads of most. This and all the others of Gladwell's work that I have read have that same engaging style, enough to help one understand and believe it and enough of the stories of real people to make it interesting and applicable.I have recommended this book to my friends and family, especially those who are in the fields of childhood education or influence and who are either children growing up in this competitive society or raising children themselves. Everyone has something to learn from this either about themselves, those they may seek to help and those whom they may choose to emulate.I liked this book. I read it on my kindle, standing in line, sitting waiting or just absorbed by its message. It was hard to put down. This was the first of Mr. Gladwell's works I read, but then quickly read others which seem to have the same merit.

  This book is great not just because it challenges preconceived notions of success, but because it forces one to re-evaluate his or her own story of success. On the one hand, it can be humbling to admit that my social and cultural backgrounds play such huge roles it what I’d attributed to my own inherent greatness. On the other hand, though, it is exciting to think of the potential that realization awakens. I may never be as great as some of the individuals discussed in Outliers, but there is no reason to think that I can’t be on a success trajectory of my own, putting in my time practicing hard, thankless work, or cashing in on the values of my great-grandparents. As with all of Malcom Gladwell’s books, he first changes the way we think about certain things, and we then have the rest of our lives to build on what it means to think differently.

  This was a fantastic read.  It's very easy to take away from this book the understanding that Outliers (amazing people) is the result of the combination of a lot of forces with the primary forces being that of being good enough, being in the right environment, practice, dedication to growth, luck and timing.  Malcom Gladwell also explains from many different angles why Outliers are not simply the ones with amazing genetics as it requires many forces to become an Outlier, including pure luck and timing.  Malcom gets the point across in every chapter very quickly then continues to reinforce the topic by diving deep in to every person/situation/story explaining them in clear detail.

  I've often assumed that super successful people succeeded because they were exceptionally talented or were very intelligent. After reading Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell, I realized what a huge mistake it is to make this assumption. It has the tendency to make me want to give up or not try as hard in my endeavors, because, what's the use if I wasn't born with the necessary gifts?  After reading Outliers it appears that talent is the least of the three elements needed for the upper echelons of achievement. Proper preparation is also required, but these two factors are not enough without the most crucial element: opportunity, the one thing that's almost completely out of our control.  As for talent and intelligence, consider this: In 1921, the creator of the Stanford-Binet IQ test, Lewis Terman, sorted through the records of 250,000 elementary and high school students and selected 1,470 children whose IQ scores were between 140 and 200 (100 is average, Einstein's was 150). He tracked their progress for the rest of his life and found that the majority ended up with ordinary careers. He was compelled to conclude that there is no connection between intellect and achievement.  In addition to intelligence and talent, one must have the proper amount of preparation. Before the Beatles became world-famous rock legends, they were given the chance to play in Hamburg, Germany between 1960 and 1962. They played at a club that required them to perform eight hours a night, seven days a week. The band performed live an estimated twelve hundred times before they took the world by storm in 1964. Most bands don't perform twelve hundred times in their entire careers. Several studies have concluded that 10,000 hours is the magic number for proper preparation.  ""The emerging picture from such studies is that ten thousand hours of practice is required to achieve the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expert in anything...In study after study of composers, basketball players, fiction writers, ice skaters, concert pianists, chess players, master criminals, and what have you, this number comes up again and again...It seems that it takes the brain this long to assimilate all that it needs to know to achieve true mastery.""  But the most important aspect of success for these outliers is opportunity. John Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, J.P. Morgan and eleven more Americans born in the 1830s are on the list of the top seventy-five richest people of all time, a list that includes Cleopatra, the last Czar of Russia, Nicholas II, and Bill Gates. Twenty percent of the people on this list were born in the same country and in the same decade.  And speaking of Bill Gates, he, Paul Allen, Steve Ballmer, Steve Jobs, and many of the tycoons of Silicon Valley were all born between 1953 and 1956, which put them at about twenty-one years old when the first personal computer hit the market in 1975. If these two groups of over-achievers had been born a decade earlier or a decade later, they would have never been in the right place at the right time. They would have missed the revolutions that were taking place.  According to Gladwell, success follows a predictable course. It's not the smartest or most talented who succeed, and it's not simply the most prepared. It's people who were given opportunities right at the time that they were most prepared to capitalize on them. In order to really succeed, you only have to be talented or smart enough, you have to be well prepared, and most crucially, you have to be given the opportunity.Written by David Allan ReevesAuthor of ""Running Away From Me""

  I'm very glad I read this book.Three thoughts, recorded for my own sake:(1) In the chapter ""The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes"" an important idea is brought up: for some people it is difficult to speak up and say what's on their mind, and as a result these people are not nearly as successful as they could be. I believe this is a very significant issue that affects many people to one degree or another. In the case of myself, I am confident that I will never come close to reaching my potential until I learn to follow the advice of the famous quote (mistakenly attributed to Dr. Suess), ""Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind."" I strongly believe that the more people live this way, the less frequently planes will crash into mountains and the more people will flourish. Planes crashing is one example that is easy to measure, but the reality is that more ""mental freedom"" (as I'd call it) literally results in improvements to essentially every aspect of one's life. In an important talk on YouTube titled ""TEDxUFM: Michael Strong - Socratic Practice as Disruptive Technology"" Michael Strong explands on this topic. Also recommended is the talk ""Coming out of your closet: Ash Beckham at TEDxBoulder"", because indeed a closet is no place to live and a closet is just a metaphor for a hard conversation. In other words, if there are fewer hard conversations because more people feel comfortable being open with each other, then there will be more success in the world.(2) Apparently either Christopher Langan lacked the desire to be more successful, or he somehow couldn't figure out how to make himself more successful despite his super-high IQ.(3) What can people--who don't naturally have success coming for them due to their environment and the circumstances in which they find themselves--do in order to become more successful? While there are very smart people like Chris Langan who apparently haven't figured it out, my gut tells me that there must be ways for essentially anybody to become much more successful than average in their lives--to have a much greater than average positive impact on the world. Maybe you can't be as successful as Bill Gates unless you get lucky, but it seems to me that it's possible for most people to have a much greater positive impact than average by setting their mind on that goal and putting in the hard work necessary to achieve it. My explanation for why most people don't become much more successful than average would be merely that most people don't have a sufficiently strong desire to put in the effort to figure out what to do to have a great impact and put in the hard work to make it happen.

  This deeply disappointing book ultimately goes nowhere.Each of the 10 sections (9 parts plus epilogue) is an often fascinating analogy that's never brought home. Gladwell is making some strong assertions - strong enough to be truly powerful if only he put in the work at the end of each section to show why we have to take his hypotheses seriously, and (ideally) how we can learn from them in our own lives.Unfortunately Gladwell does neither of these things. Instead each of his ""studies"" is in the final analysis nothing but an extended homily with no wider evidence to back it up and only the vaguest of conclusions. I really wanted to believe, I truly did. But the end of the book (which isn't very long, by the way) doesn't end in any kind of coherent strategy or life-lesson, it just meanders off into an Alex-Haley like epilogue that left me wondering what the point of the book was.With Gladwell staunchly refusing to provide any answers, I'm forced to conclude that there is none.

  My favorite quote: ""Their success is not exceptional or mysterious. It is grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky -- but all critical to making them who they are. The outlier, in the end, is not an outlier at all.""This was my first Malcolm Gladwell book, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Gladwell started out with a bang, analyzing the advantages of birth dates in professional hockey, soccer, and even education, which surprised me. From there, he wound through the histories of well known figures like Bill Gates and the Beatles as well as lesser known individuals like Joe Flom and Robert Oppenheimer. Gladwell considered birthdate, upbringing, opportunities, culture inheritances, and more to pinpoint what causes success. I loved the ending and overall message, that outliers aren't really outliers.The writing was fantastic and the facts were presented mostly in a fluid, easy to understand, way. Toward the end I had a hard time tying the stories together, and I questioned one of his claims based on the accompanying table. But overall, this was a thought provoking read that I highly recommend.

  The Outliers by Malcolm GladwellI meant to read this book years ago, but I'm glad I did. I like books that change my perspective on the world and Gladwell's books always do that! This book challenges the basis on which we judge outliers - those who stand out as brilliant -our heroes.In the first few chapters, his message is summed up by the sentence ` ...success is the result of accumulated advantage. Success is less impacted by personal ability than by social rules.' As a culture, we love to ascribe heroic attributes to others. Gladwell claims that the myth of `rags to riches through hard work and magic `are false. Other people, cultural expectations and circumstances are most likely to turn raw potential into heroes or outliers.  Hard work and focus is also a requirement of brilliance; 10,000 hours or 10 years of practice on average. Mastery is the result of relentless passion and focus in practice. Some critics disagree with this figure, but I have no doubt it is pretty close - it correlates with a great many other research articles I have read over the past few years. It also matches my personal experience.I admit I only picked up this one main story - but many books don't even give you that - just pages of information and research. Sadly, Gladwell didn't seem to research his story too well; many reviewers have pointed to specific failings of fact, such as the birth dates of hockey players. However, taking all of the evidence as a whole, rather than specific instances, I feel that his `angle' is supportable and should change the way we view greatness.Unfortunately, after an exciting start, I found the last few chapters repetitive and off track. Instead of reinforcing the original point with more and more evidence, I think there is a great deal of mileage in suggesting ways that we could all develop our potential by manipulating our thoughts and situations. I think there is a danger that people reading this book might assume all is in the hands of fate (circumstances like birth dates) or our personal connections. In fact, it shows that very little of our potential is genetic and that personal and circumstantial factors are much more important. That is an important message for us all because it is one we can influence.As always, Gladwell tells a good story and this one is worth reading at least for the first few chapters.

  It is easy to see why The Outliers, The Story of Success, by Malcolm Gladwell was the number one national best seller. This book includes remarkable stories that I found fascinating and inspiring. This book is about many different people and stories from different walks of life and how they were able to find success. Malcolm Gladwell explored how culture, family, opportunities, and time periods shaped some of the most successful people. This is a very enjoyable, easy to follow, and relatable book that I loved to read.One of my favorite examples was the story of Bill Gates. Many movies and books talk about Bill Gates and Google, but this book discussed his childhood and the hard work and many hours he put into his craft. This was interesting to me because it talks about how his early days helped shape the person he became as an adult. Another story from this book that interests me was the story about the Canadian hockey team. This appealed to me because I also play sports and the chapter talks about how many of the most successful athletes in hockey are born in the first few months of the year all because the youth hockey cut off date is January first. The boys born in the first few months are older and more physically developed and are put in a more advanced group and given more training. Eventually, these end up being the most successful hockey players. This example interested me because I played a sport called lacrosse. Throughout my career I have seen kids get held back so they are the older kids on the team, which gives them an advantage athletically and physically. It makes me wonder about the birthdates of kids on my lacrosse team and how many kids are older than me.  This book would appeal to all ages, but I would recommend it for high school students as it shows the importance of hard work and taking advantage of opportunities that can come at any age.

  Probably Gladwell's most entertaining book. We all love a good success story. A story about cases where people go from nothing to overwhelming and legendary status. This book takes apart those stories and explodes the myths and lies we attach to them. It also provides a more realistic context for understanding those stories. So with the book you get great biographical stories about the Beatles and Silicon Valley moguls and the like. But you also learn things about those stories that put their lives into a context you can understand. You realize the luck they had to get where they are. The conditions that were out of their control that they luckily fell into. You also learn of the extraordinary amount of work they also had to put in. A great read. Gladwell's best book if you ask me.

  This is a really good book.Basically the book looks at different people and cultures and considers what it takes to be successful. Some critics have suggested that the book is merely anecdotal generalizing from hockey players and Asians, but it is much more than that and I'm inclined to think that those who suggest that didn't really read the book or that they skimmed it. The book, in fact, does quite a bit of research on what makes people successful.At the risk of oversimplifying things I will note that Gladwell has two, maybe three basic tenants. First, it takes a lot of hard work to get good at something. It takes at least ten thousand hours. That is, for example, how much time Bill Gates took to master computer programming. Second, it takes someone or some fortuitous event (and/or mentor/guardian/parent) to help make huge success. Third culture, in a sense, can be a big player in success. Your culture may lend itself to seeing numbers and math in a way others don't. But, perhaps more importantly you have to come from a culture or family that will sacrifice to make you succeed.Yes, I know this sounds a bit Horatio Algerish, but the book is much more than that. Gladwell is a superb writer, more importantly he steps us through the process of how people have achieved success and the help that they got. A lot of this ought to be obvious, but sadly, it's not. Read this book and think about what Gladwell says. I'm glad I did.PS ... almost at the end of the book he has some very interesting things to say about education, primary school education. He says a lot in a very short space. He's right and the sad thing is I'm not sure we can achieve the type of education he suggests is necessary. In a nutshell, if we want to do better in this area we need to have many more days in the classroom in a structured, yet student centered environment. This probably won't sell with most.

  As a public school teacher for almost 40 years, I read this book with a jaundiced eye. How many dozens of books have I read that purport to have the answers to what is wrong with American public schools? In a sentence, Gladwell' s book can be summarized by the aphorism, ""Practice makes perfect."" However, the role of luck in being successful is frequently ignored, but Gladwell explores all of the cultural and historical advantages that others miss. The one advantage I wish he had explored in more depth is being born into a family that values education and teaches its members to value it, too.  The one thing I feel that I struggle against  daily is a lack of interest in learning on the part of students and their families. The average parent who fills out a questionnaire that I send home at the beginning of the school year  chooses a HALF HOUR of homework as the maximum amount per night they want their child to have for math and science. Gladwell talks about the value of allowing a student to spend 20 minutes on one problem! I totally agree with the premise that children from lower socioeconomic classes need more time in school to be successful, but his statistics show that children from more affluent families learn more during their enriched summer vacation experiences than they do in school. It appears that one type of public school experience does not meet the needs of all students. What a shock.The book is not about just education, though. Each chapter explores success and failure--as in airline crashes-- within the complicated contexts in which they occur. Yet the explanations are anything but complicated. The book is humorous and a quick read.

  If you've read David & Goliath or Tipping Point, Malcolm takes us down a different and very thought-provoking road that explores what makes people successful and happy. It also showcases how humans interact with machines and their surroundings as Malcolm shows us why things (and people) failed or went wrong.If you've ever had an intense and enlightened conversation on the topic of success with your college professor or the owner of a company... there's a lot more of that in Malcolm's new book.  For me, this was pretty hard to put down.  I wanted to finish this in a weekend, but found that it took me 2 weekends to read.  Many of the stories I read over and over before I jumped to the next chapter.There's a lot of interesting academic story-tellers out there, but Malcolm for me is among the best out there. Brilliant ideas, lots of inspiration and an adrenaline rush of ""wow, you got to check this out,"" was my reaction to a lot of the stories.  This book will give you a new way to view the world, and what motivates people out there to being super successful in business, academics or if you're an aspiring sports player.

  Oh my goodness i gave this book 5/5 kisses! It was an awesome book. It talks about how successful people are rarely successful on their own. Their was an advantage somewhere that they usually don’t mention. Even though persistence and hardwork is a major factor, if more people had some of the same opportunities then maybe their would be more successful people. I love how he talks about his advantages and his families advantages at the end of the book. I couldnt put the book down.

  This is a very interesting and provocative book, but, like so many pop social science books, it is marred by the author's lack of empirical research technique.Let me give an example.  (SPOILERS AHEAD)  Gladwell shows that the 25 most recent Nobel Laureates in Chemistry were educated at a wide variety of colleges and universities, most of them ""not Harvard"".  He concludes, peremptorily, that extraordinarily high intelligence is not important to scientific achievement; that is, roughly speaking, an IQ above 140.The problems with his ""proof"" are, first and foremost, a failure to understand the importance of regression in a statistical sample, to eliminate the influence of independent variables. Or in layman's terms, he ignores the fact that there are reasons people don't go to Harvard other than quantitative intelligence.  One person, for instance, went to Brigham Young.  He could have been so brilliant that Harvard would have snapped him up, but preferred BYU because he was a Mormon.  Similarly, two Nobel winners went to CCNY for their undergraduate work.  It is easy to conceive reasons why a brilliant mathematician might attend CCNY instead of Harvard.Or, a brilliant chemist might have poor English language skills; and Harvard could turn him down, despite an 800 on his math SAT, because of a 550 on the English or essay part.And, as Gladwell himself admits, so many people with very high SAT scores apply to Harvard that getting in is a crap shoot.  Harvard makes mistakes in its admission decisions, and plenty of them.  Also, due to the prevalence of the SAT as a measurement of quantitative ability, Harvard might simply not be able to distinguish between a person with an IQ of 140 and a person with an IQ of 160.Anyway, Gladwell uses ""college attended"" as a proxy for quantitative ability without any caveat, which is something nobody should do who has taken even a soft statistics course, such as ""Statistics for the Social Sciences"", in college.The book is full of faulty empirical technique.  Gladwell does not come close to ""proving"" his thesis; in fact, his attempts at proof are occasionally rather ridiculous.  Still, there are interesting and provocative thoughts and facts presented, and it is competently written.

  Good book! I even bought a copy for my son to read. He's in college. The part Mr. Gladwell doesn't really discuss is the spiritual component of the stories he brings up in the book though. At the beginning he mentions this Italian town that moved to America and their great success. He mentions their faith as a key component to their success in this introduction story, but never brings it up again. Without this developed piece the book feels like it is missing something. But, even so, it is a great book. Very thought provoking!

  Some really interesting stories and fascinating ideas.  Not sure I agree with it all.  The author is great and is an excellent writer.  I will read more books from this author.  The premise is that it is not who you are, but rather where you are in history/time that decides if you will be great.  All the robber barons of the American Industrialization were born within a few years of each other.  Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and more tech geniuses were born a few years apart.  I do seriously like the idea that it takes 10,000 hours to master something.  However, these people were born at the right time to get to 10,000 hours sooner than anyone else is what is proposed.  It is probably true, but a little depressing at the same time.  What can you spend 10,000 hours on before anyone else? Do that, and you will be the best in your field and quite possibly make a spot for yourself in the history books.  A very enjoyable read!

  -----The Good Stuff------interesting and different-makes you open up your mind-----The Bad Stuff------gets a little repetitive-----Other Comments-----As I read this book it helped me realize that there is more to success then we think. The book gives you may scenarios where people become successful and the book dissects how everything happened. It is a really interesting book, it will make you rethink how you view success in a way. (at least it did for me).Tipping point, Blink, were good books but this book in my opinion was the best out of the three. Gladwell uses psychological research and connects them with events from the past. ""Success is not really who you are, but it's where you are and how hard you work."" He has produced a new way of looking at things. It explains that having a high IQ does not really mean you will be successful, it also shows how plane crashed happen.2 thumbs up on this book! Give it to your kids to read it is a great book.Review by Anthony Sarmiento

  This fascinating book defies description. It is sobering, inspirational, elucidating and challenging, all at the same time. Gladwell weaves rich character portraits into numerous ""Stories of Success,"" providing insights on how opportunities and legacies created ""Outliers"" - individuals who somehow (and the author does an exceptional job of showing HOW) managed to distance themselves from their contemporaries. His examples are dizzyingly diverse, from the Beatles in Hamburg playing 8 hours a night, 7 days a week (The 10,000 Hour Rule)  and geniuses (being smart enough can be better than being the smartest) to Southern feuding families (die like a man) and Korean airline pilots vs. New York traffic controllers.Weaving these diverse stories into meaningful arguments through focused biographies including Bill Gates, Robert Oppenheimer and Joe Flom (the last living ""named"" partner of a large NYC law firm, whose success is closely related to his ethnicity, demographics and the garment industry), Gladwell shows that Outliers are actually not what they appear, but are individuals who were able to take advantage of the situation before them to forge their unique identities.Satisfying work, says Gladwell, is composed of three key themes - autonomy, complexity and a clear connection between effort and reward - themes that are often missing in the workday world of many individuals. As he is closing this remarkable book, he makes what I feel to be his central point: ""To build a better world we need to replace the patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages that today determine success - the fortunate birth dates and happy accidents of history - with a society that provides opportunities for all.""Gladwell punctuates this by telling a story of his own family and his extraordinary grandmother, Daisy Nation, in the chapter titled ""A Jamaican Story."" I won't spoil it for you. Read it for yourself.To quote the author one last time, ""It is impossible for a hockey player, or Bill Gates, or Robert Oppenheimer, or any other outlier for that matter, to look down from their lofty perch and say with truthfulness, `I did this, all by myself.'""

  Outliers enlightens. It tells us that success isn't just a gift, but borne out of family history, dating back the ages; it's about luck, timing and old-fashioned hard work. About 10,000 hours honed on one skill will make you an expert.Bill Gates, now one of the world's wealthiest men, just happened to be born at the right time, and was given the gift of a computer by his school, and he discovered his passion with that gift. The rest is history.Author, Malcolm Gladwell, also provides some interesting examples. Like how, in Europe, Jews weren't allowed to own any land, so they migrated to the cities and learned city trades to make a living, like garment making. Those that made it to the New World, as in New York, were the foundation of the garment district and industry that flourished. So, ancient family heritage does play a substantive part in a persons destiny, for generations.Why Asian's excel at mathematics says a lot about how misdirected the education systems in some western countries are. With few holidays, and full-year curriculum, Asian students tend to focus and learn more, not easily forgetting the Pythagoras theorem since their vacations are shorter.Outliers are people who have made it in this world, and are usually the beneficiaries of uncommon good fortune and luck, rather than shear genius.Outliers are men and women who have done things out of the ordinary, and this book explores, with some well researched examples, how these people achieve what they do, so well.

  I feel like Gladwell presents an intriguing question, but he offers no control cases, except for the case of Mr. Langan. As a scientist, and someone who looks at statistics daily, I am underwhelmed by assigning validity to a phenomenon without having a control group against which to compare the results. Gladwell fails at this, and I feel he is making conclusions based on personal emotional attachment to his family's history. This book is less a complete concept and more a hypothesis with an incomplete examination of his thesis. This was more about an indictment of the haves, and an excuse for the have-nots to assign their locus of control to external forces, than it was an exploration of what makes the successful truly successful. Tepid work at best.

  It took me a long time to pick up a copy of Outliers to read. I had read many of the print media reviews when the book came out and most, unfortunately, focused on the role of birth month on one's ""success."" I thought I knew the whole story - as many books have a single theme - and pushed it off. But its popularity kept nagging at me, so I ordered a copy this year and found to my pleasant surprise that this is a book with many more insights on life and success. It is brilliant and a must read for all.Best selling author Malcolm Gladwell in ""Outliers"" shows how each of us a product of history and community, of opportunity and legacy...not just our birth month. ""Success is not exceptional or mysterious. It is grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky - but all critical to making them who they are. The outlier, in the end, is not an outlier at all.""Opportunity comes in many forms to all - for some it is their birth month, others their birth year. It comes in the form of discrimination (color, age, ethnicity), pioneers who preceded us and changed circumstances, discipline & a focused work effort, personal sacrifice and the sacrifices of others, and in the case of Bill Gates, a woman's club buying a computer. Good ""luck"" and bad ""luck"" are spread evenly. Opportunity is determined by how we respond.

  There are books that make you think and then there are books that make you think and somehow along the way manage to change your entire perception. ""Outliers"" is the last of the two. When I received my syllabus for this semester I felt a tad miffed because I noticed that one author was mentioned twice as required reading. ""How can this ever help me with the emerging trends in higher education?""  I asked myself. The answer to that question remains unanswered; however, I have realized that this book can help me with my life and my own personal success.Like the author I have spent a decent chunk of my life wondering what it is that makes some people successful and others not as successful. Like most of the population, who haven't yet read ""Outliers,"" I assumed that these people must have some characteristics that separate them from everyone else. After all, the self-help section is full of books trying to sell you on the habits or characteristics you must have if you want to succeed. Malcolm Gladwell looks deeper into various success stories and reveals that so much more goes into success. Success is more about factors you cannot control like your birth date, your culture, where you are from. It really was a fascinating read and I have not stopped talking about it to everyone I meet. I would strongly encourage everyone to take a few hours and read it for themselves. This is not a read you will regret.

  This is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read. It essentially disproves the romantic notion that a person's hard work and perseverance overcame any and all obstacles and their achievements are entirely of their own accord with no luck and no help from anyone else. Malcolm Gladwell gracefully weaves through a wide variety of topics ranging from Canadian Junior Hockey to Bill Gates to New York City's late 19th century garment industry to show how outliers thrived in their time and place.It reminded me of a comment Warren Buffett made at a lecture I saw him give in the Spring of 2000. He talked about how his wealth came from being lucky enough to be born at a time and place when his skills and abilities were valued. He said that had he been born 10,000 years earlier, he would not have survived because his skill set is not conducive for the life of a nomadic hunter-gatherer.The key point to take away from this book is ""Outliers are those who have been given opportunities-and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them"". This is something I have known about my own life; that certain lucky breaks and fortuitous random encounters with new people has led to many of my own personal and professional accomplishments.

  This book was really interesting.  There were so many different stories throughout the whole book.  References to Rice Paddies, the smartest man in the world (IQ wise), Bill Gates, and the author's own story (to name a few).  I though the author did a nice job of reference studies/research done in conjunction with these stories - not to mention the information is provided if you want to go read the research yourself.I was already starting to read a book on the ""10,000 hour"" principle, although it was a harder read.  This book is easier to read.  Some of the chapters do reference earlier chapters, but I think you can jump in at any chapter and get it.  The version of the book that I purchased also included questions if you are part of a reading group.I'm not going to get in to the details of exactly what he covers because I don't want to spoil it, but, I'm sure you have looked around at people near you and thought ""How did that guy become a Manager?""  ""How did Donald Trump get all that money and be where he is?""  ""That guy is super book-smart - why is he in that position?""  This book may confirm your theory, and if not, you may look at those people differently next time.I recommend the book - in fact - I may pick up another book from this author.Enjoy!

  Three blocks from our office in Boston is the spot where Benjamin Franklin was born and played as a child.  Franklin is the American icon of the Self Made Man we so admire today.  His story is that those with ability and willingness to work hard can change the world.  Don't be defeated by humble origins, lack of money, or lack of education.Beyond a threshold of innate ability, hard work may be more important. Author Malcom Gladwell argues that those who are successful put in at last 10,000 hours of practice into their art or craft.  He shows how the 10,000 hour rule applies for Mozart, the Beatles, and Bill Gates.Gladwell also argues that there is more to success than ability and hard work.There is cultural heritage.  In the case of Jewish and Chinese culture, it has provided a clear advantage in American society.There are other random factors that contribute to success: what month you were born, what year you were born, whether your parents encouraged you to strive, whether your parents had money, etc.From a Board of Directors perspective, it should caution those who get involved in CEO and Board selection not to be too infatuated with impressive resumes.  And not to overpay someone because he/she was smart enough to be born in a certain year or a certain month.From a social policy perspective, this book gives hope that perhaps success is not about Great Men and Women.  There are positive factors that can be engineered to contribute to success.  The KIPP Academy,  discussed in the book, for example, takes poor urban children and makes them work as hard as Chinese Rice Farmers---with dramatically positive results.And those of you whom society regards as ""successful,"" read this book and prepare to feel humbled.Your success is the gift of cultural legacies you barely comprehend, accidents of birth, and random events you had the good sense to seize on.One last comment: there is a chapter about Geert Hofstede's research on how culture shapes personality.  In particular, there is a full discussion about one dimension called Power Distance.  Those cultures with high Power Distance or respect for power tend to have more airline fatalities than cultures with low Power Distance.  It is a fascinating discussion.  But it also has implications for those of us concerned with quality control and ethics in business.  The steps an American CEO of Korean Airlines took to reduce Power Distance within his Korean employees are well worth reading.  Companies with operations in different parts of the world will find this chapter of greatest value.  What does it have to do with the book's basic theme of success?  It really has nothing to do with it.  The entire chapter could have been eliminated.  We suspect he put it in because he thought it was important.It is important.  Read it.Larry Stybel & Maryanne Peabody[...]

  Malcolm Gladwell is the best writer of detective stories currently active, except that the mysteries he probes are found in the ""real"" world. In this book, the author encounters head-on one of the major enigmas of modernity: the self-made man, the exceptional individual who creates a new industry or revolutionizes an entire way life. Like a Sherlock Holmes of the social sciences, he exquisitely peels layer after layer of the myth and exposes certain fallacies that lie beneath our perception of the genius. Drawing second-hand from pioneering research in many different fields, the author places several success stories under the microscope and picks out apparently minor details and seemingly inconsequential quirks. He finds not only an exceptional individual, but also a set of exceptional circumstances, a generation, a historical moment, a family, an entire culture, and sometimes mere accidents.This conclusion, although interesting in itself, would beg the question of why the book is worth reading. After all, if I suffered the misfortune of not being born in the 1840's --and thus missed out on the most vital period of industrialization in the United States-- what is the use? Most of these decisive quirks are quite beyond the grasp of an individual's will. And that is where the real beauty of this book can be found. These insights are translated into what could be called the large-scale ""engineering of opportunity."" In Gladwell's opinion, the complex array of handicaps and advantages into which we are born and which shape our lives can be both a burden and a blessing, but never a destiny. And this is why the book is worth reading (aside from the brilliant writing): using the separate examples of airline pilots and disadvantaged children in a an experimental New York school, the author lays out the case for how more individuals can be afforded the opportunities to improve their lives. And always in the Gladwellian rhythm, with apparent digressions that lead through unexpected pathways to the most startling discoveries and, ultimately, to what I usually look for in a book: a sense of wonder.

  This author clearly has a gift of drawing together diverse academic studies and weaving them into a narrative that is at once simple and complex. He succeeds in giving us a powerful picture of what makes people succeed.I was grabbed by the introductory chapter and the book kept me engaged until the end.As a Christian reading this text, it strikes me as a book in praise of virtue and in condemnation of vice. That may be an odd take, but I think it is clearly present throughout the book.The book throughout praises the ethic of hard work, noting time and again (especially in the area of mathematics and rice patties) that hard work matters more than almost anything else.Yet, while praising hard work the author also shows clearly how worldly success is the result of a complex serious of demographic, cultural, and historical occurrences. He uses the word humility only once or twice. But it is a powerful concept. Those who are outliers owe their success to many, many factors, and individual merit is not the only factor for success.As a homeschooling Christian who is also a school teacher I was struck by the data on our schools. I was heartened by the recognition that yes, in fact our schools do work. I was also entirely convinced (despite the ease that it affords me) that summer vacations are a horrible idea for kids from poor or lower middle class backgrounds, and that perhaps we ought to be redesigning the schools' academic calendar to be more efficacious. My home-schooled kids are way ahead of their public schooled counterparts (I see this plainly when I go to work, and then come home and see what my wife is achieving at home). One of the main reasons is that we school year round in our household. My kids see ""summer vacation"" as the time daddy helps teach.Thus, the book struck me as a work that praised both hard work and humility, while warning against sloth and pride. That is a good message that has been around for quite some time.A great and thought provoking read.

  Fun facts and lots of interesting theories. Gladwell begins his thesis with a clear and practically irrefutable statistical demonstration showing that an overwhelmingly out of proportion number of elite Canadian hockey players were born in the first three months of the calendar year. Since the junior leagues have an age cutoff at January 1, the speculation is that at young ages the extra months of growth these lucky-birthed kids have makes it more likely that they will shine over their younger peers. This distinction gets compounded in hockey over time, as these kids get better coaching, more ice time, etc.Gladwell further builds his case by relating a fuller version of the Bill Gates story than the one that is usually told, specifically mentioning the access to computer time at his high school that was rare even for colleges in the day. Similarly he describes the same kind of benefit for the founder of Sun Microsystems, and then he lays out the history of some of the most powerful law firms in the world in New York and how they were no smarter than many other firms. After a half dozen or more such example a pattern begins to appear to even the most obtuse thinker- namely that ""outliers"" are not just talented and intelligent, but also extremely hard working and sometimes a bit lucky as much of their success required the presence of factors that were completely outside of their control. They were smart and driven, but also born in the right place at the right time.At this point you might begin to ask if this is simply another ""Nature vs. Nurture"" book, and I think to a large degree it is, with Gladwell coming down pretty strongly on the side of nurture. This was evidenced especially in his discussion of IQ, where he makes the claim that IQ scientists, whatever they are, believe only 50% of IQ is inherited. I'm sure there are some out there who say that, as there always someone who will say just about anything, but most studies I've read put the percentage much, much higher. Even his own anecdotal example of a genius IQ was a guy who could hardly have been more disadvantaged had he been raised by wolves, yet he was reading by age three and eventually tested out with a 195 IQ.This kind of non-fatal flaw shows up from time to time and demonstrates a bit of the same weakness he finds in much conventional wisdom, that is basing a conclusion on an initial faulty assumption, or developing one theory when another might serve just as well. I'd give the old analogy of an onion- he has peeled back a layer, but he has stopped there and hasn't proven (and granted it would be a difficult thing to prove) that it is the last layer.Another odd theory to me came to light with his analysis of cultural variations, especially over the ""honor cultures"" present in some regions. He explains the Hatfield's and McCoy's and other mountain feuds as a continuation of the Scotch-Irish tradition of being concerned about reputation and combines it with a study in Michigan showing Southerners as extremely quick to take offense. I personally found that ridiculous, and I'll whip anybody that says otherwise right here right now.Seriously, the Michigan study seemed almost anecdotal to me, and then he also misses the obvious fact that most of the South is not  mountainous, Appalachian or otherwise, and for that matter a big chunk of the Appalachians actually runs north of the Mason-Dixon line. He got overly ambitious trying to prove this point, I thought and his theory comes off a little half-baked.Still there is lots of interesting analysis and he writes incredibly well, with such a polish that you really don't want the book to end. He didn't convince me on every point, but that didn't stop me from finding the book extremely entertaining.

  Perhaps some of the most intense criticisms of Gladwell's work come about because his ideas are not always supported with rigorous scientific methodology. His books are good ""airplane books"", i.e., books you can read on the plane and during layovers. You can usually finish them in a day.  Really this is all he is trying to do; he is satisfying the curious reader with thought provoking journalism. Though his style might be considered persuasive, it is up to the reader to apply this knowledge to his or her life and determine whether it is relevant or true.""Outliers"" does this quite well. One idea that Gladwell reinforces is that focused time and effort is likely the only difference between some of the most influential humans and some of the least influential. At a young age Bill Gates had access to a computer terminal through his school and he took full advantage of that access. Because of this unique opportunity, Bill Gates may have had more hours logged in front of a computer than any other person in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Gladwell goes on to explain the rule of 10,000 hours. If you spend 10,000 hours doing something, you are likely to have a significant degree of expertise in that subject. An academic course of study, or the time it might take to obtain a senior position in a job might be 5 years or so, which is about 10,000 hours assuming 40 hours per week of work. it is an interesting idea and one to think about the next time you ask yourself ""is this really worth my time?"".One study that Gladwell mentions follows the family tree of immigrants in the US during the Industrial Revolution.  In some of those cases, he showed how an immigrant who worked in a textile factory would spawn children who eventually became owners of tailoring or seamstress businesses. However, their children then became doctors and lawyers, many of which were extremely successful. He illustrates how timing, a particular gap in activity, and other conditions led to the great success of some of these lawyers and how their family history made it all possible. In three generations, these families saw a total transformation of lifestyle. One thing he did not address (and I still haven't answered for myself) is why the 3rd generation was not also entrepreneurial in their vocation? I suppose to be a successful lawyer one must have an entrepreneurial spirit, but I am curious to see what vocations the 4th and 5th generations choose.I'd suggest ""Outliers"" to anyone who has asked what makes a person of history a person of history. If nothing else, it will give you something to think about on the 12:55 from Newark to Houston.

  Both a keen eye for shrewd observation and a sure grasp on historical evidence serve author Malcolm Gladwell fruitfully in this fascinating look at people who appeared at first to be ""outliers"" compared to mainstream society only to find themselves at the pinnacle of their fields through a symbiotic combination of talent, vision and intelligence. What made them outliers was out of their personal control, but what they make of the extraordinary opportunities they face is what sets them apart. Gladwell has already proven to be masterful at identifying social phenomena that no one else has discerned quite as lucidly, such as the source of fads and cultural changes in 

  
The Tipping Point









  
  
    
   and the effect of snap judgments in 

  
Blink









  
  
    
  . His approach here is no different in that he articulates his theoretical observations and then follows up with a series of brief, engaging case studies portrayed as real-life examples of his theories.The book's first section is a series of profiles high achievers and the historical conditions surrounding their successes. Gladwell puts forth the ""10,000 Hour Rule"", that is, the mastery in any field depends on 10,000 hours of practice, or approximately three hours a day over the course of ten years. Having that time made available is a key success factor for outliers. Case in point is Bill Gates, who at 13, was given access to a school computer where he could program for the next year. His passion was such that at 16, he gained access to the mainframe at the University of Washington where continued to hone his programming skills, all of this occurring at a precipitous time when computers were about to change drastically the landscape for information access. In the book's second section, the author moves away from circumstantial good fortune to the broader scope of cultural legacies we inherit from our ancestors.The most intriguing tenet he explores in this part is showing that it is more than cultural stereotype as to why Asians show strength and dexterity in academia. It started with the agrarian Southern Chinese, who have engineered and built farming and irrigation systems in rice paddies for centuries. This commitment toward efficiency and productivity contrasts with the more haphazard efforts of their European counterparts during the same time. Gladwell asks us to look at all this evidence, and we are led to our own conclusions. One cannot separate a success story from the host of events both in a person's lifetime as well as his ancestors'. Because he is an engaging writer who can tell a compelling story, the author can convey his ideas in a way that entertains as well as stimulates. He can ask questions, synthesize ideas, and connect the most remote dots into a pattern that provides not only credibility but sociological resonance. I guess the old cliché is right -- timing - as well as the right genes perhaps - is almost everything.

  This is a good book and well worth reading.  I listened to the audio edition read by the author.The author looks at extremely successful individuals and successful groups and asks what hidden advantage did these people have available to them.  He does not minimize their talent.  He acknowledges that without ability and hard work it is rare for any individual to  succeed.  The focus is to what other hidden factors were involved that made the difference.  He also looks at some who have failed.With groups such as Canadian hockey players, statistical analysis disclosed the hidden factor which was date-of-birth creating an age-differential within groups of children born within one year of each other.  I will not go into the details but would suggest the evidence seems irrefutable.There were many more examples and it appears from some other reviews that many of these examples have threatened some sacred cows.  Many people like to think that when they succeed in life it was due only to their efforts and that when others fail it is all their fault.  To contend otherwise, as this book does, is threatening.  It goes contrary to the political philosophy in some circles in America that we all get exactly what we deserve in life --- that the luck of being in the right place at the right time plays no part.This book is a simplified distillation of extremely detailed and published studies of the groups done by mathematicians, scientists and even large corporations like Boeing.  It is an entertaining easy read because the author does not dive into the statistics or minutia of these studies but instead goes to the human side.  The material is believable because it is built on a strong foundation.This book picks at another politically incorrect issue. We don't like to think that, as children, we are shaped by our culture to such an extent that we may fail.  It is disconcerting to think that a nation's culture and language could cause its pilots to be unsafe.  Why are pilots from this nation forbidden to speak their native language in flight even on their own national airline?  Read the book and you will find out.You will also find out why one slave auction in Jamaica over 200 years ago made a profound difference in this author's life.  This is a very entertaining book with a deeper message.

  I love this author and have read multiple books by him. He is great at explaining the information in an easy to understand manner. I read it a year ago and still remember interesting facts and topics taught. This book deserves a good two reads to fully understand and grasp all the information given. Recommend to anyone wanting to learn more about success. Also, my sister who doesn't read very often and doesn't enjoy nonfiction reads loved this book!

  Malcolm Gladwell takes a good crack at what makes great people great and comes up with their circumstances as a key ingredient - - - the when and where they were born, the cultural background of their families, the atmosphere of the times, the nature and character of their families, and on-and-on.  He also mentions the innate drive and ability of the so-called outliers (those who rise above the rest of us), but says none of the success would have happened if it were not for the fortuitous circumstances.Is he talking about chance, destiny, or fate? I have my own opinion about whether how these circumstances arise, and I don't think it is accidental. How many things in your own life, if you think about it, seemed destined to happen? As an example, my uncle was part of the invasion of Italy in WWII and met his future wife there. My aunt and uncle didn't know each other's language and GI's had a bad reputation there for taking advantage of girls; but because they thought he was a priest, they felt he could be trusted around my aunt's family. He wasn't a priest but carried a book that looked like a Catholic Missile used in the Mass. By the time, they were able to communicate well enough (over weeks?), he was trusted and loved. They were married after the War and had children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren. The marriage lasted 60+ years until she passed away a couple of years ago.I've often wondered about the sequence of events that led to my birth, going back centuries. How many fortuitous things went into continuing the family line until it got to me and my siblings?Bottom line is that the stories of the highly successful folks like Bill Gates, are really as much of a story of circumstances as innate genius. At least, this is Gladwell's take - - - and mine as well.

  The book, ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" by Malcolm Gladwell teaches readers the fundamentals of recognizing opportunities and taking advantage of them. The many examples provided in the book offers a blueprint in the shaping of one's own destiny. One of the most important tenets of the book was that autonomy, complexity and a connection between effort and reward is the portal through which people become successful.You can make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, but if your work does not make you happy, you do not become fulfilled in life, which is the goal of every person on this planet. Without fulfillment, or the sense that what we do is satisfying and meaningful, we become aimless and unhappy because there is very little that will ultimately make you feel happy or fulfilled in life.Other lessons of the book extol that success follows a predictable course. It is not those with the most money that succeed. It is not those that are the most famous that are successful. It is not those that are the brightest or the smartest in the world that are offered the most lucrative opportunities. Success, in a nutshell, is determined by those who are offered an opportunity and who have the strength and presence of mind to seize and take advantage of them.This book has taught me that in order to become successful, you cannot wait for your ship to come in; you must swim out to it! Meet challenges head on, persevere and embrace the opportunities that come your way, regardless if they are big or small, significant or seemingly not worthwhile. Behind every action we take is the potential to make our lives, and the lives of those around us, a much better one. We are all born to be successful in our own way; knowing how to use the opportunities given to us is what will get us there.Overall, I feel that this book offers a very good primer for people, especially those ready to embark on life's journey right out of high school or college, to immediately make a positive impact in their lives. This is a great book, and while a somewhat quick read, the lessons and stories shared within are invaluable to those looking to make a difference in their lives.

  Rarely do I find such great storytelling skill in works of nonfiction. I went chapter after chapter excited with Gladwell's perspective on Outliers.

  This is a story to read that will change your perception on things. I'm not saying it'll change your life or anything but it will change how you look at things. It'll make you question things more throughly. I enjoyed it very much. It contained a lot of factual information that with a grain of salt, made a social theory on how and why people are successful/the way they are. It shows that people are successful due to the help of other and their situations, not luck. It's a good read if you like theories!

  Malcom Gladwell returned with another stellar read. Not only was this book filled with facts, it was interesting and well written. I was engaged and curious until the last pages.This should be required reading for all expecting and new parents. As I fall in that group, I am thrilled to have learned what made people like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, the Beatles, and NHL hockey players from Canada standout superstars in their fields.My favorite part was learning about how income and parenting strategies correlate to successful children and adults. Definitely a must read if you want to understand why some people are ""Outliers"" and the rest of us regular folks blend in with the crowd.

  Just finished Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers and it is by far one of the most interesting books I've ever read.The book looks at how people are successful. The idea in our world is that success comes from hard work, being smarter than the other guy. But what Gladwell points out is that is not the end of the story. Sometimes, you can be those things and not be successful.Gladwell looks at how to know whether your child will be a star hockey or soccer player based on what month they are born in. What the Beatls and Bill Gates have in common. Why Asians are so good at math. Why star New York lawyers have the same resume.""Outliers are those who have been given opportunities - and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them. For hockey and soccer players born in January, it's a better shot at making the all-star team. For the Beatles, it was Hamburg. For Bill Gates, the lucky break was being born at the right time and getting the gift of a computer terminal in junior high. Joe Flom and the founders of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz got multiple breaks. They were born at the right time with the right parents and the right ethnicity, which allowed them to practice takeover law for twenty years before the rest of the legal world caught on.""This really was a fascinating read on why people are successful and why others are not. All successful people are not the same, sometimes you have to be born at the right time, in the right place, to the right family. But then, you have to do something with it.[...]

  This  is a great read! Often in a conversation I'll bring up part of this book.  I'm looking at success differently now. What would appear to be luck or coincidence is given support as a series of events that lead the individuals within a group to the success detailed. Hockey players, computer ""geniuses"", musicians, business people are all given the deep dive into what allowed them to be at the top of their different fields. The book is broken into chapters that can be read individually similar to a book of short stories.  I read this over a long period of time and didn't lose anything by not picking it up daily or weekly.

  As a teacher of high ability 6th grade students, I was naturally drawn to this book, Outliers: The Story of Success, by Malcolm Gladwell.  I’m always more than curious about what my former students make of their lives.  One of the most rewarding parts of my job is when I reconnect with them on down the road.  But what is an outlier?“Outlier - noun \-ˌlī(-ə)r\1.  : something (as a geological feature) that is situated away from or classed differently from a main or related body2.  : a statistical observation that is markedly different in value from the others of the sample”So begins the introduction to this book, about the best, the brilliant, the most successful, and what makes them so.  Research to support the nature vs. nurture question.  And, alas, it is both,  ”…they are invariably the beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies that allow them to learn and work hard and make sense of the world in ways others cannot.”But this book is more fascinating than just that.  Did you know it takes 10,000 hours to become a master at a skill?  Yes, 10,000 hours.  I found myself  mentally calculating the number of hours I have spent sewing or reading or teaching, or doing any other single skill.  Have you ever thought about how cultural differences can critically affect air traffic controllers’ or pilots’ and copilots’ communications?  Or what dominant hockey players have in common?  How does the year you were born impact the chances of your success in a certain area?

  I found this book to be fascinating and it made me think, and ultimately change my philosophy of the relationship of brilliance to success. Using a variety of subjects, Gladwell poses his theories relative to the opportunities presented, hours experienced and mental capabilities of some of our well known success stories.  I found out some things I didn't know and came to understand some things that I knew - but had never assembled and reviewed in this manner. I love books about ""people"" - their experiences, attempts, failures and successes - so I found this book very interesting and have purchased multiple copies for my friends and acquaintances - such as this one. You may be challenged and you may not agree with all of Gladwell's conclusions - I didn't - but I think you would be hard pressed to read this book without smiling occasionly saying, ""I never knew that"" and perhaps even changing the way you look at and approach success in life.

  Parts of Outliers hit home for me.  I am a retired psychologist who worked with children with special needs.  I was born in November in the early post World War II years.  Typically I was the among the youngest children in my classes. Since there was more of us than in previous generation, competition was fierce.  I struggled until I became an adolescent.  With encouragement but with little tangible from my parents, first generation immigrants who needed to work instead of getting an education, I stuck it out.  It took a while but I earned my PhD, being the first in my cohort group to complete and defend my dissertation.  Thus I also liked the section on the KIPP Schools.  My son is a commercial airline pilot so the section on plane crashes and cultures became a topic of conversation between us.I know that not everyone will relate to Outliers to the extend that I did; however, Gladwell writes well and I recommend this and his other books without reservation.

Outliers is about the combination of effort and sheer luck needed to pull out extraordinary success like Bill Gates or The Beatles. The stories and the social science behind them is fascinating and Gladwell's prose makes it an easy, liquid-like read. For people who like to think and want to know how things work, this book is for you.

  I think the goal of this book is to provide readers, especially disadvantaged readers, with new ways of thinking about their own behavior, the world around them, and how they relate to that world. I think that Gladwell's goal is to inspire paradigmatic changes in the way disadvantaged people approach their lives and think about their futures.For the educationally privileged and those people who are mired to the teeth in statistical jargon and stuff like ""psychometrics"", ""Outliers"" will probably irritate them because it doesn't back anything up with huge amounts of reified ""data"" and it makes metaphorical use of the concept of ""outliers"" rather than using the term in its most jargon-approved sense. Instead what it does is tell stories. And it connects those stories to observations. In short, it presents a series of case studies in such a way as to let the reader come to some striking conclusions about his or her own standing in the world and what can be done to improve upon it.Statistics is only science in the fields of science. In sociology, psychology, linguistics, cultural studies, etc, it's a physics-envy pretense, making it every bit as useful as astrology or numerology. So, this book, which completely avoids all the numerological reifications commonly made up using meaningless statistical jargon, actually has something to offer. It presents a case, and does so intelligently in a way that respects the reader's intelligence and powers of comprehension.This book will mean the most to those who have something to gain in changing the way they think about the world. I think it is for the benefit of these people that Gladwell writes.

  My Siamese, who loves to play, was into this toy from minute one. It is very interactive and engages mentally and physically. I read the reviews before purchasing, but did not anticipate such an overwhelming reaction. She cannot walk by it without stopping to play. This stimulation is very important to me, as she is the sole kitty in the house and does not have a ""buddy"" to play with.  I highly recommend this toy with regard to every aspect- cat appeal, construction and durability, cost and the fact it does not take up a lot of space. This is only the second product review I have ever written, so take that as an additional positive statement for this toy.

  Malcom Gladwell does another fine job of storytelling while informing the reader of things they likely hadn't considered.  It drives a stake through the heart of the American fantasy of ""I made it all on my own"" - ""I'm a self-made person"".A richly rewarding read.Bravo, Malcolm.For those who crave more details and more statistical data I recommend ""Peak"" by Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool.  It's a different take on success but doesn't distract from the story Gladwell tells.

  Gladwell's books continue to take a subject based in ""common wisdom"" and flip it over to find the surprises dwelling underneath. He did that in the ""Tipping Point"" and ""Blink"" and he again does it here.I heard him interviewed on NPR just as this book was just coming out, and I wondered if he had gone beyond the limit of political correctness by looking at cultural issues,language, race, religion and class.  So I bought the book somewhat reluctantly.  What I found to my delight was a well researched and well reasoned look at the causes of high performance that do have a basis in these ""PC"" taboo subjects.To me there is nothing depressing in understanding that many high performers have gotten to be where they are on the basis of being exactly in the right place at the right time with the right generative culture milieu. That's enlightening.  Yes, we probably all can't be Bill Gates no matter how hard we work.  And we don't choose our parents, our birth date or birth order, or our culture.  But our circumstances don't mean that we shouldn't develop our skills to the highest levels and work beyond the expected limits with what we have been given.  Perhaps you are the next ""outlier"" and don't even know it.I always look forward to Gladwell's books for their fresh point of view.I recommend this one.

  I have read both of Gladwell's previous books, and this one is another fascinating achievement. The book reads much like his other books, Blink and The Tipping Point, with some overarching themes and a lot of interesting examples, data, and narratives.Gladwell's main point is that the nature of success is not what we traditionally think it is: a mixture of innate talent and hard work. Gladwell acknowledges the importance of these things, but he also theorizes that success takes a very precise mixture of coincidences, history, timing, culture, and upbringing, among other things. Other reviewers have noted that the book wasn't revelatory because Gladwell basically says you have to work hard and be talented to be successful; I didn't find this to be the case at all. Instead, Gladwell really made me think about success, and about the series of coincidences and mixture of things that make up who we are and what we become, differently. I had a hard time putting it down, and was fascinated by a lot of his examples and data.My only criticism, and it would be very slight, is that sometimes his points are a bit drawn out and repetitive. I didn't really mind this at all, because I never lost interest in the new examples he brings up to illustrate each point. I highly recommend this book and I think it would make anyone think about success in a different way.

  This great read makes one point clear - there are several ingredients that will need to come together to drive success.  While not a “self help” book, this for me opened my mind to opportunities that - with my special set of “ingredients” - I am in the right place and time to pursue.  There are a massive number of takeaways we should consider as a society in USA, particularly in my opinion in suggestions (studies) done on primary education styles.

  Gladwell does a great job of showing you ""the other side of the coin,"" when it comes to success.  Gladwell examines factors those who are successful have no control over.  Advantages they inherently had.  He uses studies as a basis or proof on what he is explaining, which I thought was cool and really validated what he was saying.  He picks great examples and this really helps the book.  The examples are strong, well rounded and of very successful people (Bill Gates, Bill Joy - SUN Microsystems, The Beatles, Youth Athletics, American VS Western Education/Cuture)In the beginning of the book he seems to play this off as more beginning, and it seems to bother him more as the book goes on.  He then talks about the 10,000 rule, which is a cool rule I will allow you to explore by reading.  As the book goes on, it seems to get more bleak and he lost me a little.  I really did enjoy the facts, examples and cultures he examines.  He simply start to become a little too morbid in my opinion, but it did not detract from the value of the book.The book is a great, quick read.  If my review is short, or didn't quite help you form an opinion, let me do it for you now - read this book.

  I was incredibly excited to get my hands on Outliers after reading both Blink and Tipping point in years past. I often call Gladwell my favorite author.However, his 3rd book is a poor followup to his past best sellers. In short, this book seems forced. Like he wrote it only because his fans expected another book from him, not because he was passionate about the subject.There are 2 sections of this book and they couldn't be more different. I struggled to transition from the first to the second which really took away from my enjoyment of reading.I will say that the individual topics he writes about are interesting, but he just doesn't dive deep enough. That deep dive compared to other authors writing on similar subjects is what I came to love about Gladwell, and it is flat out missing from this book.If you have read his past work you will probably be disappointed by this attempt. If you are new to Gladwell you will probably find some enjoyment in this book. It is more Freakonomics than it is Blink. That is, it's more amateur than it is professional.

  The first chapter is good, but the latter chapters are becoming worse. I gave up on the fourth chapter, so cannot say much about the things after that. But for the first several chapters, not many practical suggestions are given other than working hard. The main theme is genius is not born genius, they are ordinary people. But how can you replicate their success? Woops, the book just doesn’t care. Pretty disappointed... Might be an encouraging book, but far from being useful.

  I enjoy reading Malcolm Gladwell quite a bit. Each of his books offers a bit of a different take on a main topic. I think that Outliers is one of my more favorites, probably because it felt like there was more stories.Although I don't always necessarily agree with some of the assumptions or conclusions, the reading, research and insight is very interesting. I also very much appreciate his writing style. Malcolm Gladwell draws you into his story then takes you on a journey. I'm often left wanting more after reading one of his books.The title of this book could almost be ""Outliers: The Myths of Success"" because of the very interesting way in which he dispels what we typically view as successful characteristics. I found this book particularly interesting because of the work I do in organizational transformation...very insightful.

  It's funny - despite my general openness about personal matters, this is probably the subject I am least comfortable talking about. When someone is a genius, you go through the first 20 years of your life constantly trying to hide it so as not to be seen as a pointdexter, sycophant or snob. ""Oh, it must be so HARD to memorize a complicated song in one day or ace all your tests without studying, tell me more about the problems in your life"" you imagine 'friends' sneering behind your back, rolling their eyes. The effortless ease with which highly gifted people take on tasks is actually a highly calculated veneer over the same frustrating obstacles as others without seeming arrogant while doing so. The enormous expectation to not just do one's best but to constantly dominate your previous record and everyone else's leads to the eventual sinking realization that there simply is not room in this world for more than one ""the best"". As both popular science and psychology are starting to confirm, being a genius is in no way a predictor of life success despite every individual's good fortune and efforts, and Malcolm Gladwell's book 'Outliers' is the best and most accessible explanation I've read as to why.Impressing people without even meaning to is one of the earliest memories I have in life. After devouring all of the chapter and picture books I could get my hands on at pre-school age, my parent's classics and old science textbooks (or at least the ones I could reach off the bottom shelf) seemed the next natural step. Dad frequently retells a story in which he asks me as a toddler how I got to be so smart; I replied ""good genes"". Public school has no idea what to do with a kid who signs up for kindergarten being already able to read novels, play piano sheet music and execute batch files in DOS. I was tested at age 7 with an IQ of 163 upon entering the second grade, having already been skipped a grade ahead as well as being a year younger still due to having a September birthday. This conflict between being significantly younger than my peers at a critical age of development and also several standard deviations more intelligent than them was to be a continual source of strife. I begged and pleaded with my parents not to hold me back, not understanding the implications of being so much less emotionally mature than my peers. On the first day of class I got sent to the principal's office for taking my shoes off and refusing to put them back on. At 9, the teachers were fed up with me reading or drawing and 'distracting others' in class but also couldn't fail me when I was getting perfect grades, so I was pulled out and sent to a private school for the gifted, where after a year of constant boredom (diagnosed and medicated as ADHD) and other behavioral problems my teachers treated me as a class scapegoat and suggest that I be better off homeschooled or back in public school. These events marked the beginning of a long scholastic career of underachievement, contempt of authority, and befuddled administrators who weren't sure whether I belonged in the gifted program or Special Ed.I was lucky enough to be born into a white, middle class family in one of the most highly educated and prosperous parts of the United States. My parents were psychology majors who read all the right books and took all the proper steps in terms of nurturing the development of a gifted child without stifling or overloading me. So why am I not in the same percentile of overall life success as I am in test score range? Gladwell goes into the many statistical reasons why the high-IQ child is no more likely to become successful than any other child when demographic influences are controlled for, some factors as completely out of our control as being born in the wrong month of the year. He also gets down to what I believe is the true difference between successful and unsuccessful people, the willingness to work hard. If I had been self-disciplined enough to put in the hours academically to master unfavorable subjects with the same voracity with which I took to computers, art, music and reading, plus a less cynical attitude towards the school system, I might have gotten a full ride scholarship to any of the best universities in the world. As it is, I'll have to settle for a community college degree acquired at age 19, being published and owning my own business by 21, and knowing that if I do desire to learn a new skill at any point in life, the only thing standing in my way is myself. (Though, as a side note, I definitely pick up new skills a lot slower than I used to as a child and find myself stymied more often, indications that my IQ has dropped either from aging or drug/alcohol use, something that I try to compensate for with extra patience).Though it will always be embarrassing and awkward, I've gotten used to the incredulous stares and people asking ""how did you do that"", though I never had a particularly good answer. ""Lots of practice, the opportunity to be in the right place at the right time, and luck"" is the old standby, though it sometimes felt insincere. Now, thanks to 'Outliers', I realize that's not an overly humble explanation of genius. If I ever have kids, I will not subject them to a barrage of tests in order to find out exactly how ""special"" they are. I will accept that they are special simply on the virtue that they are them, listen to them to find out what they truly love to do and push them to achieve high but realistic expectations. And that's my advice for children of all ages - do what it takes to be whatever you want to be and do the hell out of it.

  I absolutely loved this book. It's clearly written, suspenseful and engrossing, it has great examples and overall taught me a lot. Great read, makes me want to work harder and have more grit, as well as hopefully figure out what innate advantages kids born in the 80s may have! 😀

  I read Outliers, The Story of Success for a school summer reading assignment, and I thought it was an interesting book but there were parts that I found pretty boring. I did feel like I learned a lot throughout the book and was able to take away a lot, which was the point of the assignment. But there were chapters of the book I found very hard to concentrate because it wasn't very interesting. I felt like the book started out interesting, which I liked, but then towards the middle I found myself actually dozing off when the author talked about certain topics I was uninterested in. But over all I would recommend it to someone who is interesting in questioning the theory to success.

  As in ""The Tipping Point"" and ""Blink,"" Malcolm Gladwell once again helps explain how the world works.  Covering a wide range of examples ranging from rice farming in China and Canadian hockey to airplane crashes and the rise of Jewish law firms in New York, Gladwell promotes the thesis that timing and culture are key ingredients to success and that innate talent is less important than most people think.As in his previous books, Gladwell writes clearly and continually reinforces his points by returning to points made earlier in the book.What is interesting is that Gladwell is not afraid to frame some issues in cultural terms that some could consider politically incorrect.  Particularly interesting is the final chapter in which he addresses his own racially mixed multi-cultural background to show how he arrived at the successful position he now enjoys.As in his other books, Gladwell provides no original research.  Rather, he pulls together information from the research of others to support his thesis.  The book is well written and very readable.  My only complaint is that, while he makes excellent points, he sometimes understates the fact that, in addition to luck of the draw, talent does still matter.

  Outliers made it to the #1 spot as a national bestseller, and it's well deserved.  It is interesting, clearly written, and the argument is logically presented and, for the most part, well supported.  The book's central ideas are 1) that brain power, character, and motivation are overrated; 2) other factors—often not easily recognized or not given enough significance—such as where and when a person was born, his or her family history, and the particular twists of fate and coincidences in a life story, are integral to the success (or failure) of an individual.While his second premise makes sense to most of us, it is frequently downplayed in favor of intelligence, desire, ambition, and other character traits when analyzing the achievements of the famous and highly successful.  No one, no matter how smart and driven, can do it alone, says Gladwell.  And he insists that enough favorable factors must come together to clear the path and propel the individual to become a winner.  For example, Bill Gates was born at the right time (computers coming into their own), to wealthy parents, and through various fortuitous events ended up in a situation that gave him unprecedented access to computers in the late 1960's when he was only an eighth grader.  Various individuals acted as facilitators to make it possible for him to continue his programming work through high school and into college.  In Gates words, ""I was very lucky."" Gladwell recognizes that Gates was brilliant and driven, and those faculties no doubt played in his favor, but the author maintains that the right circumstances—the precise state of technology when he was just the right age, the financial means, the mentors and coincidences—had to be there.  He supports the argument by using contrast, including examples of extremely intelligent individuals, geniuses in fact, who were also highly motivated, but whose life circumstances did not favor them, and thus failed to achieve their enormous potential.  In fact, he shows that high intelligence is an advantageous factor in achieving success only to a point beyond which it does not matter how many more IQ points you register.Curiously, Gladwell misses an opportunity to advance more of his basic premises when analyzing the success of the Beatles, instead narrowing his focus on the break the band got by accepting a gig in Hamburg, Germany, which forced them to play a variety of music genres many hours daily, seven days a week before they took America by storm.  His emphasis here is the number of hours the Beatles played during that time, which made them much better musicians, but he does not highlight that the turbulent 1960's were ripe for radical change in various areas of society, music being one.  One of the author's main points in other parts of the book is that the period in which a person happens to be alive has an enormous influence on his or her personal life outcome, and the Beatles are a perfect example of that.  And yet, Gladwell does not seize the opportunity to emphasize this.  Quite odd, really.The influence of culture in determining success or failure in specific fields is interestingly illustrated in Gladwell's analysis of airplane crashes.  Until recently, Korean Air had a relatively high number of accidents, and it was discovered that this was largely due to their culture, which frowns upon the questioning of authority.  It was found that Korean co-pilots and flight engineers were extremely hesitant to question the Captain's actions and decisions, much less clearly convey their concerns, when they detected potential problems.A similar situation resulted in an Avianca (a Colombian airline) crash in New York in January 1990.  In that incident, the factors of bad weather, a very tired flight captain, and a malfunctioning auto-pilot were exacerbated by their being on a holding pattern over the city while running out of fuel and the first officer's reluctance to convey the gravity of the situation forcefully enough to the very busy and commanding  New York air traffic controllers.  He did not want to anger the ""authorities,"" so the exchanges via radio maintained a business-as-usual tone until the plane eventually ran out of fuel and crashed.Gladwell offers many other fascinating and surprising facts in Outliers, such as the odd relationship between successful hockey players and their birth month, why the 1930's was the perfect time for New York Jewish lawyers to be born, why the 1950's residents of Roseto, Pennsylvania seemed immune to heart disease even though their diet was loaded with fat, few were committed to exercise, and many smoked heavily and struggled with obesity.If you find these extraordinary social phenomena interesting, you will like this book.

  Gladwell's writing is capable both of being utterly convincing (the phrase ""selling ice to an Eskimo"" comes to mind) and of taking a simple truth readers already know (that success comes from our own very specific, cultural circumstances - in addition to hard work) and making it seem as though it is shockingly novel and groundbreaking (his thesis focuses on trends of success that are counter to, or sometimes not even considered in, our expectations).This being said, Gladwell's ability to storytell makes even the mundane charts and numbers within the book riveting. His writing is easily digestible while still highly informative, full of thoughtful imagery while still fast paced, and, as always, entertaining. Although this book seems slightly more entertaining and less applicable (compared to The Tipping Point or Blink), it is nonetheless a fascinating read.

  Malcolm Gladwell has given us another page turner. After The Tipping Point and Blink, I for one have come to expect a lot from him. The writing is better than in his previous books. The book is written as a series of essays on remarkable people. He asks the question, ""How did these people become remarkable?"" In most cases, the answers are surprising. Rather than dismiss success as a matter of great, unusual ability, Gladwell digs in a little deeper. He proposes, pretty convincingly, that there is much more to success than unusual ability. He shows that it is often rooted in cultural background and temporal events (eg being born in the ""right"" year).Those seeking success in this life might find the book both encouraging and discouraging. It's encouraging in that success does not always depend on unusual talent or abilities. It's discouraging in that success may, very often anyway, depend on factors well beyond our control. I didn't agree with all of his conclusions, but his research is undeniably captivating. This is an engaging book that will challenge your thinking.

  I am not a genius, and it is not my fault. That is pretty much what you will get out of this tremendously interesting and thought-provoking book.The premise of this book is pretty simple: to reveal the truth behind the notions of intelligence, fame, and success. The American dream has always told us that our success is directly related to our work ethic. As long as you work harder than the competition, you will win. But if you dig just under the surface, you will find is nowhere near true.In Outliers you will see how you birth date can make you a better athlete, how your 10,000 hours can make you an expert, how timing is absolutely everything, how culture-sensitivity can mean life or death, and how IQ is simply nonsense.To say it simply, this book was just a fun read. I enjoyed stories and the numbers, and I loved seeing how such little things can affect the big picture.

  I read Malcolm Gladwell's ""BLINK - The Power of Thinking Without Thinking"" and enjoyed it very much!!  I chose ""Outliers"" just to read something else by this author.  I was not remotely disappointed - in fact found this book to be favored over the first one.  I found that his ideas provided me with an understanding of ""true life success"" in a manner that I had never considered.  Perception is the individual's Reality and this book changed my perception.  I was personally challenged and inspired like I cannot believe.  I did not give it 5 stars because if you are not a person who desires to  ""stay"" with a detailed thought process, - you might find the writing tiring but my recommendation is that when you get to that point, ....just put it down and pick it up later.  You won't be sorry.

  I understand Mr. Gladwell's thesis to be that outliers are not really outliers at all; that extraordinarily high achievement -- be they hockey players, Bill Gates or the Beatles -- comes from a combination of luck and circumstance, which is largely out of an individual's control, and sustained and prolonged application of one's abilities (often called hard work) to make the most out of the opportunities that luck and circumstance have allowed.  The suggestions for equalizing opportunity are interesting, as they call not for reducing someone else's opportunity but simply for some adjustments that are common sense and fair.  Two examples: hockey players in Canada have a decided advantage the earlier in the year they are born, simply because a 9 year old born in January is usually far more developed physically and otherwise than a 9 year old born in November.  It seems a good argument that perhaps twice as many good hockey players would be developed if the hockey player age groups were split into 6 month increments rather than a year.  Another example is the education achievement gap for poor and middle class or upper middle class children.  They start out pretty close in testing and learn at very close and similar rates during the school year.  However, the poor children regress significantly between the end of the school year and the beginning of the next school year.  As the school years pass, the gap widens.  A change in the school calendar would be a sensible reform.  Finally, the discussion that math aptitude correlates strongly with willingness and inclination to sit and work the problems is one that too many parents will no doubt recognize.

  A short handbook meant to be a cheerleader-type moral-booster for people who don't ""stand out"" enough. 10,000 hour rule? What an original rewording of the American Dream. I appreciate the fact that he acknowledges the reality of the ""fruits"" of hard work, though. A fun read, but Outliers' argument is based on fallacies and anecdotal evidence. This is basically pseudopsychology mixed in with a bit of imagination.

  Loved the down to earth tone when talking about  some of the greatest people on earth. If you like to know what makes people jump higher than the average Joe, or why lighting strikes every second and why no one will ever see or hear this, the universe has its hero's. To the businessmen or lawyers to inventors and or actors, this book helps bring people to a common thread, and that is to become the best in what ever you do, You will never know where it will take you. I have this book because I know some people of industry that you would never believe the amount of success they have had, one of my personnel theories is to mingle with these people and see how they think, they are no different than you or anyone else. The real true thing I see is that they are open to all sorts of ideas and with some of there own they"" ACT ""on it, and bet the farm on it. They believe in themselves they do not look at the failure aspect, they see it as a learning curve...

  That's the most appropriate title I can think of for this great piece of science.  In a nutshell, Gladwell illustrates how important our past and enviornment plays in how and what we do as we mature.  This is a brilliant but simple expose on what all the genius stuff is all about.  No longer does a family need feel they are not going to have their young grow up to be leaders.  Its all about the parents.  We are the creators of our own children's destiny.  And for so long parents would complain about how this system and that person stood in the way of our child's success...WRONG!  its us.  No, this is not a book on child rearing...or is it?  its a scientific no-bull***t fact-based study on why we are what we are.  I love all the case study stories--they're really interesting--of those whom have risen above and succeeded.  And I love the fact that ""Outliers"" says We Can!!! Plain and simple.  Great book

  I picked up this book after achieving a professional milestone and feel the need to relax and take my mind off computers for a while. By the end of this book I am so motivated that I am ready to tackle other big projects again. Why? This book reaffirms the idea that as long as you are 'smart enough' you can achieve great things in life with hard work, persistence, and the right circumstances. The first two are absolutely necessary in order to take advantage when the opportunity knocks on the door. There is a systematic approach and pattern to the 'outliers' of the society.This book also makes me realize that whatever I have achieved in life, I did not do it alone. The high school teacher who encouraged me to participate in AP classes, the college professor who gave me the intern opportunity, the manager who hired me without any relevant experience, even my Asian cultural background may have played a part. As an individual, we are in debt to so many people who have helped us. This is an interesting and inspiring book, high recommended.

  I thought the start of the book was pretty neat...hockey players getting an advantage because of their birthdays, entrepreneurs who benefited tremendously from external circumstance, etc was a good story.  And he applies it to a larger social message that since increased opportunities are what help cause these positive outliers we should focus on providing as many opportunities as possible.  He kind of lost me in the second half of the book though.  I'm not from the South but some of that was borderline offensive.  And while the stats may show Asian students are better at math, I'm not convinced that patience with rice paddies is really the reason.On a side note Gladwell seems like a decent guy and I hate people avoiding controversial topics because they're afraid of being perceived as insensitive.  But boy, some of the second half of the book sure seems like it's heading down a slippery slope when it comes to applying general rules to ethnic groups.Finally, I'd be curious to read one of his books with a normal book size and missing a lot of the charts he throws in (like 3 pages of when the richest people in history were born).  I know I'm probably nitpicking but does he get paid by the page?  Those 320 pages had like 50 solid pages of material.  I think Gladwell is a good journalist who can write a great 20 page magazine article but none of his 3 books have blown me away from cover to cover.

  I got this when a kind stranger on a plane recommended it to me after an hours conversation. He said ""I think you're going to find yourself in that book"" and he was right. If you want to know why some people succeed regardless of circumstances this is a great start. It's not about luck and I don't know if it can be taught, but it's much harder to get our children moving in the right direction when they have to go through our uninspired school system and even harder to inspire them to greatness if they begin believing in the ""system"" as the way there. Read it and see if you don't recognize yourself, a relative, a friend, or an acquaintance in the pages and then remind yourself that it's never too late to value thinking for yourself.

  Malcolm Gladwell really hit the ball out of the park with this book. I've always been skeptical of the notion that all a person needs to do to become successful is simply ""lift oneself up by one's bootstraps"" and just do it.There is just way too many actors involved, such as coming from a great family that is smart enough to know how to guide you, living in an environment that has the infrastructure to support your ambitions, having a patron or belonging to a ""good ol' boy"" system that will put you in play, and so much more. No human being has the ability to do it alone.Gladwell lays out the facts in an easy to read format and he also lays to rest this insane notion that guys like Bill Gates simply got rich because of their own ambition and intelligence and nothing more.I only hope that the right people read this book and realize that all children no matter who they are and where they came from deserve an opportunity to survive and thrive. That's all I have to say about this review.Just read it.

  Outliers is somewhat of a bait and switch. Rather than being a simple book about the inner workings of the super-successful, it's mostly a tome about society.Of course, Gladwell's thesis is one I'm sympathetic toward. Namely, Gladwell argues that a large part of success is rooted in both social circumstances and luck. One prominent example given is Bill Gates who, according to Gladwell, wouldn't be where he is today if his preparatory school hadn't purchased a computer. And while I agree with this to an extent, surely it cannot be the whole story.  What made Gates different from all the other children in his prep school who had the same opportunity with computers? What was it about Gates which drew him to computing and made him stick with it for so many years when others gave it up? Gladwell doesn't delve into this, preferring to leave it mostly at `luck.'Overall, Gladwell fails to make a cogent argument for this thesis. Almost every bit of evidence provided by Gladwell is anecdotal, and much if it dubious at that. Take, for example, his profile of Chris Langan, a man with a very large IQ who turned out to be somewhat of a failure in life. Gladwell uses this anecdote, which spans two chapters, to show that IQ doesn't matter as much as familial support. Yet Langan comes across as nothing more than an egomaniac who happens to be extremely good at the puzzles on IQ tests (and reading his cooky ideas and watching his game show performance only solidifies that opinion). But rather than questioning the validity of IQ tests, Gladwell is completely taken in by this story.Of the few statistical studies used in Outliers, they tend to be small sets of data which Gladwell uses to draw grandiose conclusions. Near the end of the book Gladwell refers to a study which has failed to be published in an academic journal because ""it's just a bit too weird."" Anybody who has ever read an academic journal will realize that this excuse rings tremendously false, whereas the odds of it simply being a poor study are much higher (and, incidentally, the study isn't all that weird anyway).More than anything, Outliers comes across as an exercise in confirmation bias. Gladwell is rightly skeptical of stories of the ""self made man,"" yet is uncritical of any story which happens to support his thesis. In addition Gladwell downplays the importance of genetics, a discussion which is sorely lacking in this book. There's no doubt that Gladwell knows how to relate stories in a fun an interesting way. However, it's unfortunate that he's not more careful with his research and arguments.

  Lots of insights into successful people like Bill Gates, Beatles. Success is the accumulative advantage, so having 10,000 hours' practice early will give you the head start to become outliers. Last but not the least, working really hard, harder than your peers is still the most important factor.

  Book Review submitted by: Stephen J. Hage, SteveH9697@aol.comGladwell has a way of looking at the world that's different from the way most of us do.  A large part of his talent lies in his ability to see things that, even though they're there, we tend to miss.  He displayed that unique ability in The Tipping Point and in Blink and delivers, in spades, once again in Outliers.The book explores people who do things out of the ordinary by delving deeply into how and why they were able to do what they did.  Using his unique way of looking at the world, Gladwell offers surprises few would even think to look for.In dealing with who gets to the top in the hockey world in Canada, Gladwell looked at the player roster of the 2007 Medicine Hat Tigers.  The salient feature of the roster is that seventeen of the twenty-five players were born in January, February, March or April.  Looking deeper, he shows why that's so.  The eligibility cutoff for age-class hockey in Canada is January 1.  ""A boy who turns ten on January 2, then, could be playing alongside someone who doesn't turn ten until the end of the year--and at that age, in preadolescence, a twelve month gap in age represents an enormous difference in physical maturity.This being Canada, the most hockey-crazed country on earth, coaches start to select players for the traveling ""rep"" squad--the all-star teams--at the age of nine or ten, and of course they are more likely to view as talented the bigger and more coordinated players, who have had the benefit of critical extra months of maturity.And what happens when a player gets chosen for a rep squad?  He gets better coaching, and his teammates are better, and he plays fifty or seventy-five games a season instead of twenty games a season like those left behind in the ""house"" league, and he practices twice as much as, or even three times more than, he would have otherwise.  In the beginning, his advantage isn't so much that he is inherently better but only that he is a little older.  But by the age of thirteen or fourteen, with the benefit of better coaching and all that extra practice under his belt he really is better, so he's the one more likely to make it to the Major junior A league, and from there to the big leagues.""Turns out that in hockey, in Canada as in so many other endeavors, besides talent, timing, circumstances, and luck play a big part in separating winners from losers.The book is filled with similar stories chronicling what elements, in the lives of people like Bill gates and groups like the Beatles, illuminate how and why they became so spectacularly successful...such outliers.To be sure, talent is an important and necessary ingredient but, in and of itself, it is almost never enough.Gladwell's singular strength is the way in which he sees the world.  His writing ability then creates a lens through we get to see the same things he sees.This is a good read and I recommend it without reservation.

  Thank you Malcolm Gladwell for writing a book essentially on LUCK!  This book has changed my world!  As a hard worker, there were times when I didn't understand why my hard work didn't produce success, or that it would take so long to see results...but now I understand very clearly that sometimes it's just a matter of waiting for LUCK to show up and being prepared when it does!

  Malcolm Gladwell manages to turn research books into stories that are engaging and exciting. It's a real gift. In ""Outliers,"" Gladwell supposes that there's no innate ""talent"" gene; that the Bill Gates' and Wayne Gretzkys and Robert Oppenheimers of the world are at least as much the beneficiaries of chance as they are of some talent that is so far beyond the rest of humanity. What's surprising is the deluge of research Gladwell trots out to support these assertions.Birthdates and next-level athletic cutoffs,what junior high and high school had a computer terminal, the culture of a kid's home life... they're all not just factors, but apparently DECIDING factors in determining how successful a given person is at a given craft or skill.The only reason I held back one star is because Gladwell doesn't go very far at all in trying to suggest how to harness his research. A terrific follow-on would be a study on how to use this data to CREATE outliers... wildly successful individuals.

  I had bought this book as a required text for one of my education courses at my university. At first glance, I figured it would simply be another book to read on my long ""To-Do List""; however, I quickly realized I was totally wrong. Outliers hooked me in from the very beginning and challenged the very way I look at success. I thought it was crucial for not only me to read it as a future educator, but all people should read this book as it will truly change the way you look at the world and your perception of others and their so-called success. Overall, great read and I highly recommend.

  I wasn't blown away by this book from a 'enlightening' point of view, but it was a very enjoyable book. I loved the stories of other people, their experiences in life, and how it helped to frame their success and future. I was encouraged by this book to continue working hard at my skills and future, because I also truly believe its the countless hours of practice and struggle that makes someone an outlier, including of course the environment they are in.

  This is a must read for anyone who wants to understand success today and what makes a successful person. Malcolm is astonishingly persuasive without being strident or authoritative in a pedantic way. He has his facts, and I believe that he is spot on about most of what he writes. I enjoyed listening to him speak. He is clear and I liked his tone and delivery. What he wrote here is significant as well and applies to all of us whether we consider ourselves particularly successful or not. Read it or listen to it. This is a must for a literate person of this era.

  The Outliers is a look at what author Malcolm Gladwell thinks make a person successful. Gladwell talks about family, location and time of being born.  These are all subjects that define us to the point whether we struggle getting the success or stuck at the bottom.I thought the first half of Outliers was interesting as Gladwell talks about months and years people are born that may factor into a person success.I was more or less bored reading the second half which discussed families, and locations that define how hard you are going to work to be successful.  I also did not agree some of the facts discussed in the second half.Outliers is an interesting read.  I picked it because some of the other books I had been reading mentioned it.  I would be interested in some of Gladwell's other books.

  Overall this appears to be a light-weight work to me - besides the 10K hour rule, and the cultural impact on success (including the PWI), I don't get much. It made you slightly less motivated to chase our dreams, since you are presented with all of the stories and analysis about the critical success factors that are out of your own control in a way. It is a good book to spark some thinking and conversation over dinner table. However I won't want to read it again because there is no need - you can finish it quickly and understand/remember perfectly the straightforward points the author wanted to convey. I would give it 3.5 starts if possible.

  The main point of this book is that successful people aren't successful just because of their efforts but also because they got lucky in some ways, for instance Bill Gates was lucky enough to have been a young curious man with access to a computer in a time when it was very hard to get access to a computer.The problem is that the author is trying too hard to make this point by bringing up examples of relatively successful people from the 18th and 19th century and very often it is just pure history for entire pages, which is very boring.

  Once I started this one, I could not put it down.  I had already read ""10,000 Hours"", which this builds on.  This does a fabulous job of showing how some of our most famous cultural icons, like Bill Gates, Tiger Woods, and the Beatles, succeeded to the level of great fame and fortune not just through individual effort.  Also studied are the early figures from the Rockefellers and the Morgans (as in JP Morgan).  There were circumstances that allowed these famously successful figures early access to the 10,000 hours required to build real expertise (for sports, computer programming and musical performance as a band), and in all cases there was a ""right place at right time"" factor that was critically important.  Fascinating!

  I enjoyed reading the stories in this book.  It made me think.  I suppose it does take more than 10,000 hours of practice to become a top notch musician or athlete or scholar.  Success does take more than just brains and hard work. Success also involves being in the right place at the right time and some luck.  I agreed with everything in the book.  It makes me sad for the intelligent and hard working people who are not successful for any number of reasons beyond their control.  Some people come from home where the parents are a hindrance to their children. Other people have a skin color or religion that is being discriminated against.  That is unfair.  As a wealthy society we lose out on great talent and ability when we don't give a chance to people who are different from us.

  While the book is very detailed and thought provoking all until the last chapter, it falls flat there. While the author makes a good point, the shift from third person/abstract to first person/personal circumstances and history leaves me less interested in the subject of outliers, and almost reluctant to ask why several hundred years of British colonial history should qualify the author for inclusion in this book along with the likes of Bill Gates. I'm chucking it up to authors privilege, but realize that I was fine until that point; the unbiased and non-autobiographical approach to some interesting characters and psychological concepts about outliers were an entertaining way to spend a Sunday.I would and will recommend this book to people, but I am not quite sure how to recommend that they should skip the last chapter.

  Mr Galdwell, lays out specifically why some of our greatest Icon's succeed where others do not.In a time when some people say if you're not rich its your own fault, Mr Galdwell shows where people like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were in the right place at the right time with the right passion. I have taken his 10,000 hour rule to heart, as I am attempting to learn piano.Sometimes it is our own inspiration, our own get up and go that takes us to new heights of success, but sometime its as simple as a rule on how old you need to be to start playing hockey as to when you can get on the hockey team. Sometimes those rules stop you before you get started or they are the very door to your success.I could go on but let me say this... I think if you have children, this is a must read. If you want to understand how to master aspects of your own life this is a must read.I think Gladwell is a genius, but then he probably has more than 10,000 hours practice at it.

  This is such an interesting view on success, failure, circumstance and opportunity. It gives credence to the idea that there are always larger forces at work when it comes to making a name for oneself in his or her chosen field. My only real complaint is I would like to have seen more subject examples - particularly in the fine arts - with fewer pages spent on each one (Once the points are made, things get a bit repetitive). Other than that, it was really an enjoyable read, the stats alone being worth a look. It definitely tilts my world view a bit!

  I enjoyed reading the book. It made me re-think how I perceive abilities to perform certain types of work. It also brings forth the idea that the most commonly help view of intelligence is was too simplistic and that we must consider emotion, social, and other forms of intelligence beyond logic or pattern recognition. Many times we put our own barriers in front of ourselves and take away opportunities to try new things because we think ""only someone like ___ could do that"".However, as the old addege goes ""practice makes permanent; it doesn't make perfect."" I must call the reader to question the assertion that 10,000 hours or more will make you an expert and the inference that much of what brings about success is the sheer amount of time invested in learning a skill. It is important to realize we often stop short in learning something; yet, it is also important to realize that while you could spend tons of hours learning something that there may be a particular thing you simply enjoy doing more than another or that you're simply better at. Motivation must not be a forgotten factor as it plays a pivotal role in driving us to become great; rather than just good.Overall, much food for thought. I highly recommend it!

  Wow, what a book! Every minute I read ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" I was extremely engaged and intrigued. In ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" (2008) by Malcolm Gladwell, many patterns are analyzed as to why some people are more successful when compared to other people. Gladwell suggests that it is more than meets the eye; successful people are not only those who have the drive and will to be the best they can be, but successful people are born during the just the right time, giving them more opportunities than they would have if they were born just a year or two later. The examples Gladwell provides us with include how most of the greatest Canadian hockey players just happen to be born during a certain time of year, asserting that this is not just a coincidence but instead a pattern. He also explains why Korean pilots had more frequent plane crashes compared to pilots from other countries, why Asians are generally better than most at math, why Bill Gates was destined to excel in technological innovation and many other examples of outliers all over the world. Furthermore, it is evident that Gladwell did not simply formulate and write down his arguments within a day, instead, he put in the time to research the patterns he described, providing the readers with a plethora of statistics to verify his claims with. I believe that the read was even more exceptional for me since I started to make connections with these various patterns described throughout the book. In my case, I excel in school and many people believe that it is because I have a strong passion for doing as good as I can in school. While this may be true, I feel that there is a deeper explanation than what most people at my school see, just like how Gladwell thinks. I think that since my mom was a teacher for most of my childhood years, I had an advantage over my peers in school at a young age which has now transferred over to high school, allowing for my success.In conclusion, ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" was a great read, and I believe many others will not only enjoy the book but also make connections to it whilst you read!

  If you've come here thinking that Malcolm Gladwell's latest book could well be a repeat of his previous two instalments, then you are going to go away disappointed. This is definitely not in the same league as the previous two books.It starts with an interesting argument, and of course, some interesting data, just to 'suck you in'. But Mr Gladwell fails to take the argument to a conclusion. The data of course is interesting but it fails to convince. It probably reinforces that there is indeed a million ways to interpret data, but really, this is data without a purpose.Outliers is worth a read, if only to compare it to the previous books - I don't think I'm labouring the point too much, because clearly this book is intended to shine in the reflected light of the previous publications. Mr Gladwell is working hard to keep the franchise alive - similiar covers, typefaces, layout etc, but really, the subject matter is very light weight.If you enjoyed the previous books, go ahead and buy this one, but don't expect the thrill and engagement you experienced in the first two to be repeated.It would make a nice Christmas gift for someone though!

  The entire premise of Outliers is that the successful among us are NOT the product of luck, but rather the hard efforts of work. Sure, certain among us were the result of circumstances beyond their control, but the underlying message is that if you work hard, you can be a success. A wonderful book that should be read by all and studied so that as a society we break down our preconceived notions that some are lucky and others are not.

  I enjoyed reading this book but I guess I didn't read the review or summary of the book very well.  It really wan't what I expected.  It was a good read,  but when I was finished, "" I was kind of like, what was the point?"" It seemed like the whole book, while filled with very interesting information, explained how people that are incredibly sucessful were either born at the right time or came from the right family, etc. Chapter after chapter the book spelled out that anyone who is a true outlier, didn't necessarily achieve it with just thier gift, they had to be born at the right time or come from a certain family, or be in the right place. I kept thinking that at some point that all this data and statistics were going to be useful for applying to my personal self, but that was never the case. I didn't find the book inspirational, but at the same time, it kept my attention to the very end.

  What I took from this book is that success is largely based on practice and luck. It does a good job at showing how one seemingly minor decision can be the start to a career of success, without you ever knowing it then. It was a good book that seems often criticized by people claiming he twists his data to prove his theories, but a lot of what he says seems like common sense. For example the 10,000 hour rule. If you take it literally, you might think that 10,000 hours of practice magically results in success. That's an absurd criticism I've seen too much of. Take him seriously, and you'll understand that Gladwell isn't saying that at all.It's a good book that's well worth reading.

  I gave this book three stars. Two means you do not like it. That is a tad strong. On the other hand three stars (It's OK.) is also not quite right. The book -- small pages, large print, around 200 pages -- is not like one of those cheesy self help books with 2/3 padding but this book is padded. The idea -- the quirky things that make for success -- is a good one and the book starts out fine. Gladwell, however, does not have enough examples to fill a book. So, he starts with birth dates of hockey player but then goes to socioeconomic class (hardly news) and then a extended narrative about himself.Even at its most interesting there are problem. For example, if hockey and other sports stars tend to be the oldest kids in the age group, are college football stars the ones who flunked an early grade? If his theory holds, who not check across several contexts.The book is just thin in more than one way.

  The central message percolating within Outliers is the context of one's life must never be ignored nor given short shrift.  But is it not true that we cannot measure success until in many instances far past the life has been lived and historians may be the worst at finding where success has settled?  We are far too complex and the connections of the stretch of our lives much too complicated to give the proper value due each person.  How can we possibly know if Bill Gates or Abraham Lincoln were truly successful because we cannot know the full ramifications of their work and lives?  Everyone thinks they know what success is, as if it is intuitive and yet what is the true plumb line for success?  Do we really have a handle on that?  Was Stalin a success because he got the metro system in place in Moscow?  Was Micky Mantle a success because he built a Hall of Fame career?  Was Charles Dickens a success because he wrote critically acclaimed and immensely popular novels?  Are we certain we know what a successful life is?

  Outliers is the first Malcolm Gladwell book I have read and I can honestly say if the others are half as good then I am looking forward to all of them.The basic premise is that the narrative of the ""self-made man,"" which has been a corner stone of ""Americanism,"" is a fiction. Although it was obvious in retrospect, it was fascinating to read success stories as diverse as Bill Gates or professional hockey players and realize how often it was random chance that gave them the material advantage that led to their successes. In the end, you need to have the talent and you need to be willing to work hard but, as Gladwell writes very aptly in his book, no one makes it alone.This book caused me to change my perspective, for the better, on success and I highly recommend it to anyone who has faced adversity and begun to question themselves. It may be that case that you have the talent and the drive but you just need someone to give you a chance - so keep trying, don't give up.

  This book had been recommended by a friend, and since I had read Gladwell's THE TIPPING POINT and liked it, I decided to give this a try.  It's a fascinating study of some of the real underlying elements of success: it doesn't really come ""out of the blue"".  Gladwell points to chance opportunities that successful people have taken advantage of, and how those opportunities aided the progress of the person under discussion.The most talked about part, in my circles of creative friends, is the 10,000 hours of preparation aspect.  Gladwell draws from several different success stories, of widely different professions, which show that it is not a fluke that 10,000 hours of practice and preparation go into making the masters of any field.  It is a challenge, laid out in very pragmatic terms, to anyone who wants to succeed at anything. In the back of my head, I kept hearing the old joke: ""How do you get to Carnegie Hall?"" ""Practice, practice, practice.""  It's funny because it is seriously true.Gladwell has a very comfortable style, making the book a pleasure to read.

  The simple truth that talent alone is not enough to guarantee success, which is the thesis of Outliers, is beyond dispute and, at some level, an obvious one. But Gladwell brings to this work, his third bestseller in a row, such enthusiastic scholarship, persuasive reasoning and command of language, that he reinforces the lesson indelibly. Despite the heaviness of a few sections here and there, Outliers is a highly readable work and some of its descriptive passages, like the preface to his chapter on Harlan, Kentucky, are truly memorable. The author's thesis is that extraordinary achievement is less about talent than it is about opportunity. It is not the brightest who succeed. Outliers are those who have been given opportunities and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them. The case histories he uses to illustrate his arguments are familiar ones to which we can easily relate, especially when he peers more closely behind the well-worn stories of contemporary superachievers (Bill Gates, Jewish lawyers, Asian students) and looks at the convergence of all the other factors (some fortuitous - dare we call it luck?) that create the opportunities for their talent to flourish. The autobiographical account at the end is particularly effective. He includes a glancing reference to a fellow superachiever of Jamaican descent - his cousin Colin Powell.

  Wow, does this book ever suffer from a severe case of foot-in-mouth disease!I almost didn’t make it past the introduction. In my pre-publication copy, Gladwell writes, “The Sandra Bland case came in the middle of a strange interlude in American public life” and then goes on to discuss a series of cases of police violence against black people that happened around 2014.“Strange interlude.” Really?That phrasing suggests that this treatment was some sort of aberration in American history and that the violence only happened during the few years he references. Did Gladwell really mean to ignore America’s long history of this problem?I don’t think so? I think he may have meant that the attention paid to police violence was unusual, but dude, choose your words much more carefully.Later on, there are some good points made about how and why we tend to misunderstand each other.But, again, I almost put the book down, this time while reading the chapter on the Brock Turner sexual assault case. Without going into detail, that chapter could only have been written by someone who's buried his head in the sand over the past five years or so.It’s tough to ignore the problematic elements of Talking to Strangers. I could definitely see the discussion of the causes of sexual assault offending some readers to the point that they abandon the book altogether. I’ve definitely enjoyed other books by the author a lot more than this one. Two stars.Thanks to NetGalley and Little, Brown and Company for giving me a DRC of this book.

  It's odd to see some of the reviews.  I waited until I actually finished the book before adding some thoughts here.If you are new to Gladwell, you will greatly enjoy ""Talking to Strangers""... as it is a must read for anybody who needs to make snap judgements about people's character and behavior.Of course, if you are a fan of Gladwell, you will of course enjoy it, especially if you hear it on Audible.  Gladwell produces the Audible version as if it was an extended episode of his ""Revisionist History"" Podcast.

  Malcolm Gladwell is a gifted writer who engages our minds and emotions in his works of non-fiction. In ""Talking to Strangers,” he tells us true stories that, at first, seem to be unrelated.  A police stop ends in tragedy; Neville Chamberlain and other political figures famously misconstrued Hitler's bellicose intentions; experienced judges grant bail to defendants who, they realize too late, should have remained in jail;  the sociopath, Bernie Madoff, conducted a fraudulent investment scheme for years, deceiving many individuals who thought that he was a genius at making money; Amanda Knox served prison time for a murder that she did not commit.Studies show that most of us who encounter apparently benevolent individuals are predisposed to believe that they are not putting on an act.  Conversely, when we meet a man or woman who behaves weirdly or inappropriately, we are likely to jump to negative conclusions about him or her, even when there is little hard evidence to support our assumptions.  The author suggests that many of us have an inflated opinion of our ability to size up people.  Research suggests that we are not as objective as we would like to believe, and are therefore prone to misinterpret comments, intonations, facial expressions, and gestures. Moreover, we do not always realize that people whose backgrounds differ from ours may communicate in unfamiliar ways.Gladwell asks: How did double-agents who telegraphed their guilt get away with their treasonous behavior for so long?  Why didn't everyone recognize Madoff for what he is—a ruthless swindler?  Which of Amanda Knox's personality traits, remarks, and deeds convinced Italian authorities that she killed her roommate? These compelling examples raise intriguing questions about why we sometimes reach erroneous conclusions when we assess the truthfulness of our fellow human beings.  it should be noted that a few chapters in this book—such as the essays on suicide, young adults who drink so heavily that they black out, and the efforts of police to cut down on crime—are thought-provoking but oversimplified and not particularly relevant to Gladwell's central premise.  Still, this work of non-fiction is an entertaining and enlightening wake-up call. We should be cautious when we decide who our friends are as opposed to who is likely to stab us in the back. Too often we are dead wrong.

  Let me start with what Malcolm Gladwell believes happened in the Sandra Bland case. During the 1970s, there was an experiment conducted in Kansas City, Missouri, which found that increased police patrols had no effect on crime. During the 1990s, a similar experiment, again conducted in Kansas City, instead targeted extra police patrols in very specific high-crime areas - and by very specific I mean city blocks, not streets, blocks. That experiment was incredibly effective and demonstrated that stopping individuals for very minor traffic infractions led to an increase in arrests, gun seizures, drug seizures, and, most importantly, crime.Law enforcement agencies around the country took notice; sadly, they walked away with the wrong lesson. The officer who stopped Sandra Bland that fateful day had been trained to stop potentially suspicious individuals for very little reason. He was further trained to look for evidence of guilt rather than assuming anyone was just going about their business. Why? Because law enforcement agencies extrapolated and thought that what worked well in a very specific high-crime area would also work everywhere else. That just wasn’t the case. It led to an overly suspicious police force and, of course, the general populace growing increasing wary of encountering police. It also unfortunately disproportionately impacted African Americans and ultimately led to the Black Lives Matter movement.I am a HUGE fan of Malcolm Gladwell's work. He singlehandedly taught me to appreciate nonfiction. His books are both informative and entertaining, educational but really enjoyable to read. Outliers in particular has stuck with me. I also enjoyed his other books, not counting What the Dog Saw, which was a bit different from the others.In any case, I have been looking forward to Talking to Strangers since I first heard of its upcoming release. It does not disappoint. I have a master's degree in anthropology, so Gladwell's own description of Talking to Strangers spoke to me immediately. After listing high-profile examples including Sandra Bland, Brock Turner, and Amanda Knox, Gladwell says: “In all of these cases, the parties involved relied on a set of strategies to translate one another's words and intentions. And in each case, something went very wrong. In Talking to Strangers, I want to understand those strategies—analyze them, critique them, figure out where they came from, find out how to fix them.”Largely using high-profile cases with which readers will be familiar, Malcolm Gladwell wants to teach us how to communicate better with those who are different. He presents us with two puzzles:First, why can't we tell when the stranger is front of us is lying to our face? (ANSWER: Because we default to truth. Society could not function otherwise. There don't just need to be red flags for us to recognize deception - there need to be an overwhelming number of them.)Second, how is it that meeting a stranger can sometimes make us worse at making sense of that person than not meeting them? (ANSWER: Because we assume transparency, meaning we assume we can read their intentions on their faces and through their actions. It turns out, we can't. We're really bad at it.)“We have people struggling with their first impressions of a stranger. We have people struggling when they have months to understand a stranger. We have people struggling when they meet with someone only once, and people struggling when they return to the stranger again and again. They struggle with assessing a stranger's honesty. They struggle with a stranger's character. They struggle with a stranger's intent.“It's a mess.”It is this mess which Malcolm Gladwell hopes to make more comprehensible.As always, well written and highly readable. But I am dissatisfied with the conclusion. How do we best talk to strangers? ""What is required of us is restraint and humility."" Sure. We need to acknowledge that strangers are complex and that we have no clue whether they are telling the truth or lying and that we certainly can not read their intentions from their facial expressions or actions. That's the humility part. The restraint part is recognizing all of that and not assuming we have a clue. But what Gladwell fails to do is actually give us a template of how to talk to strangers.Talking to people is confusing; the older I get, the more I recognize that. I have long since gotten that defaulting to truth can be problematic but assuming that everyone else is lying is worse. I don't have to look any further than neurodiversity to grasp that someone who fidgets or avoids eye contact may not be guilty of anything other than a diagnosis that is unknown to me. While this book was enlightening and informative on a large scale, on the minor scale that is my life, it did not teach me anything I did not already know in my quest to talk to strangers - and that is disappointing. I remain as bewildered as always by the other. And, I suppose, recognizing that already puts me ahead of the game.EDIT: I have continued mulling over this book, and one thing puzzles me. Gladwell says repeatedly in the first half of the book that the correct course of action is to assume others are telling the truth because lies are rare. But liars are not rare! As he demonstrated with the quiz experiment, when given the opportunity 30% of people cheated - and then lied about it! I suppose you could assume lies are rare if you also assume that most liars don't lie all the time. I prefer the maxim ""When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.""

  Malcolm Gladwell is the best non-fiction writer working write now. He does such a great job of using engaging stories to convey his points that you often forget that he is building towards an overall thesis. This book is no exception . . . while I think that this one may be more controversial than many of his other books, it's just as important.Gladwell boldly takes on two of the most complex social issues we face today, sexual assault and racial discrimination. He asks an important question, which is that maybe we don't understand strangers as well as we think we do. Maybe, the media makes assumptions to fit their narrative, and the public quickly goes along with it. We assume that we are able to discern other's motives and reasoning, even though the vast majority of the scientific evidence states the opposite.I live and work about 15 miles away from where the Sandra Bland arrest occurred. I had no idea that the book would focus on this when I pre-ordered it, but was interested to see what he had to say. In my opinion, he gave a very balanced account. He goes beyond the 'bad apple cop' vs. 'victim who didn't act properly' debate and exposes a much bigger issue in our criminal justice system and our world, namely that we don't know as much as we think we do. I'm betting that he will get criticized because of this, but its important to note that by pointing out larger societal problems with how we train and expect officers to behave, it does not diminish personal responsibility. In fact, by writing books like this that expose problems to the system for all, I believe it increases personal responsibility for those who have authority.My main purpose in writing this review is not not to persuade those who loved Gladwell's previous books (like me) - they will buy it. Nor is it to persuade non-readers to read this, as they likely won't. But if you are a reader who reads a negative review about and decides to dismiss the book without reading it, I think you are making a mistake. Assume the best in Gladwell, just as he advocates in this book, and read with an open mind - you will learn something, and you will enjoy doing it. Be sure you read the endnotes as well, some great stuff there too.PS - The most shocking chapter to me was the one on the Sandusky case. I had never gone beyond the narrative portrayed by the media and was very surprised to read about how things played out here. Will be picking up at least one book on this case to read based on this chapter.

  A brief overview revealed a biased text, at times void of common sense (at one point describing an 'alleged' theft caught on surveillance camera and viewed by millions online and the news). The book and Gladwell's narrow view within it only got more contrived from there. Unlike his usual work that seems to blend an objective scientific approach with broader personal insight, this work seemed a directed, goal oriented work bent on expressing a very narrow opinion. Six years wait for this? I can't believe opinion takes six years to try and justify. Should've been called commentary not non-fiction. Very disappointing and not worth the expense to purchase or time to read as far as I'm concerned. Returning!

  Malcolm Gladwell has at this point created a distinctive style of non-fiction. Social science research is combined with various narratives and then woven into a meta-narrative about something of widespread interest.That “formula” is more or less followed in Talking with Strangers. However, with more success and experience Gladwell is less focused on simply saying something interesting and more focused on effecting reform in society. And, as with any person with a message for change in America, he takes positions that are bound to be uncomfortable and controversial.The phenomenon at the center of Talking with Strangers is that, uniquely in modernity, we no longer live in a village or tribe where we know most of the people we interact with. Based on solid psychology, Gladwell explains that most humans have a default reaction to trust strangers.  When we don’t we rely on what Gladwell refers to as transparency—the idea that one’s inner self is revealed by facial gestures or body movements.Compellingly, Gladwell describes that people who don’t trust strangers are not necessarily the model we want to follow.  The same man who acted as a whistleblower against Bernie Madoff also holed up in his house fearing a government assassination.  If we don’t default to trust we end up in a society few would desire.Along the way Gladwell builds his case for sensible ways to navigate the stranger filled world by citing cases as diverse as Amanda Knox and Jerry Sandusky.  Some of the stances on controversial cases are going to offend some readers, but there’s really no way to discuss topics like child abuse and date rape without offending someone.By no means does the reader have to agree with all that Gladwell says. However, his ability to build evidence leading towards a persuasive conclusion on how we should act towards with one another is a good example of how popular science should be conducted.  You can disagree that aggressive policing is being applied incorrectly or that alcohol consumption is a key factor in the rise of date rapes. But then you have to criticize Gladwell’s ideas and evidence.  While he’s not writing a peer-reviewed paper, the ideas in this book are amenable to scientific criticism.I actually liked this book the most of anything Gladwell has written.  Too many of his earlier books seemed written to pique one’s interest while having little real impact. Even if you find him offensive, self-righteous or just plain wrong you can’t deny he has something important to convey. Hopefully, Gladwell will continue to turn from focusing on the merely piquant to the central issues of the day.

  The underlying storyline of Sandra Bland was very myopic. Wasn’t Bland also talking to a stranger? Did she not also have some defaults to her truth that made her combative?  Not to Gladwell. Very liberal perspective that doesn’t account for 2 sided conversation. We’re all talking to strangers.  And we all have the responsibility to be understood and to understand the other. Not just gun owners or policemen or men.Oh well this reviewer is just being defensive. He’s “triggered”. Yes. And in this entire book, the triggering party is the one with the responsibility to communicate in a different way. So... perhaps the author should consider how he talks to strangers.

  Doesn’t live up the high standard Gladwell has created from past books. The title was misleading - should really mention more about our lack of skill identifying liars not strangers.

This is coming from someone sexually assaulted at age 17 in broad daylight while stone cold sober. I wish I could return this junk.

  1st chapter is a let down. When LEO (yes a black or white officer-and male or a female)asks you to get out of a car, you do it. Why refuse if you have nothing to hide? Why run if you have nothing to hide? Perhaps you should share what POs see on a day to day basis in this country before you attempt to judge. The best thing cities can do , is have the general public engage in real-life simulations presented by local or state police. Or, have all the people that hate the police, go through the academy and be the change they want to see. I'll finish this book, but I'm already let down and taking the author's words and views very lightly . This is a book I will likely return.

  This is my first book by Gladwell as he was an author that was recommended to me.  As a speaker and teacher of Emotional Intelligence and Diversity Inclusion I am constantly reading and learning from different perspectives.  After struggling through the first 5 chapters I felt I was inundated with negativity and how we should live with a fear based mindset!  This goes against all the principles I teach and live by.Perhaps that was not Gladwell’s intention as I believe he was trying to get his point across about looking deeper into people, but I feel it was not well delivered.I may have misread his intentions, but after 5 chapters and still not receiving any strategies of “understanding” though I can offer plenty of my own, I did not find it beneficial of my time to continue reading.

  First, I'm an avid Gladwell fan. I love his work. I've read every book, can't wait for each Revisionist History episode (his podcast), and read his works in various publications. I love his ability to convey a story, delve into data and nuance while maintaining interest, and perfectly make a sharp and often novel point by the end. I purchased the audiobook at the recommendation of his podcast after listening to the sample he posted and was not disappointed in the production quality. I'm an Audible member and always buy audiobooks. This one set a new standard for the format. It was captivating to listen to - masterfully done in the same style as his podcast. However, (SPOILERS - stop now) that sharp point so notorious in his work was missing in this book. The storytelling was great, but the premise (that we cannot understand others, discern their intentions, or understand their context as well as we think we can or at all) was not the profound perspective shift I've grown to love about Gladwell. Yes, there were some interesting points made, like that overly paranoid behavior with strangers is counterproductive as an alternative to a ""default of truth"" and that we tend to judge others as transparent 1-dimensional people we can read clearly, but do not believe the same judgement should be applied to ourselves. The stories were told brilliantly and I enjoyed listening to all of them, but they were told in service of a thesis that did not, in my opinion, justify such arduous dissection. All of that, to be honest, still would have gotten this book 5 stars from me - but, I was left with a bit of a bad taste in my mouth in the way some stories were portrayed, especially when it comes to Brock Turner and Sandra Bland. For example, with Brock Turner, Gladwell uses this to make the point that there's a fine line of consent. Men and women see things differently. Under the influence we see things differently. A lot is left up to interpretation. However, in this case, there was no ""miscommunication"" and a mismatch of signals interpreted as what was consent or not... the victim was literally unconscious. There are millions of stories that could be used to show the nuance of communication and interpretation in consent - some involving celebrities... this was not one. I get the points these stories were designed to illustrate, but I felt they were used for their notoriety, not their ability to underscore the point.  Gladwell's podcast episode on a police-involved shooting illustrated this book's point better than the somewhat clumsy and also disconcerting analysis of the Sandra Bland case. I still say this book is entertaining and extremely well done (of course it is; it's Gladwell). It's still worth the time. The point is a good one to learn, but not Gladwell at his best.

  Survivors of sexual abuse or assault be forewarned.  Your experience may seem minimized by the author.  I’m shocked by higher reviews.  Were they hiding from every information source during the Jerry Sandusky case?  If you want to see Amanda Knox without her mistaken guilt (or not mistaken) for “youthful American goofiness,” watch her documentary.  You might be surprised what her body language conveys.  The fact we misunderstand strangers isn’t a new discovery.  This is amplified when drugs and alcohol are involved.  Again, not new.  Like many others, the Brock Turner chapter or Case Study:  The Fraternity Party, is at a minimum cringe worthy, if not vomit worthy.  Being drunk may cause miscommunication about whether one is willing to proceed with a sexual encounter.  Really?  Victim blamers belong with Ariel Castro.  Is there any action by an unconscious person suggesting, “yes, it’s okay to put a pinecone in any orifice of my body”?  Thankfully Swedes teach a lack of consciousness doesn’t mean, “yes,” to sex.The book is Gladwell’s least interesting and most off-putting.  Simply put, it’s a long, offensive version of why we’re told not to talk to strangers as children.

  You have to laugh. Gladwell chose to channel discredited conspiracy theorists instead of original sources to put the white girl on a pedestal and put everybody in Italy down. An angry ill-researched rant. There's a false claim on almost every line. What of Patrick? What of the enormous evidence? What of Knox RIGHTLY serving three years? What of Sollecito's uncle Rocco who organized to spring the pair?  Read the ongoing expose on True Justice dot Org and see for yourself how Gladwell swallowed a conspiracy theory whole.

  This book is a meandering mess. Moreover, chapter 6 is such a false metric or means to arrive at analizying empicarical evidence (An “elegantly” engineered facial analysis method is touted as being employed). Chapter 6 relies on the the TV series “Friends” to analyze facial reactions and shifts to arrive at a conclusion about events that arise in this TV series, and take these reactions as being true and objective...this is a flawed means of performing any analysis.My point, the paid actors are not displaying candid expressions, but rather scripted facial expressions, and being that the authors is  extracting what he believes to be empirical evidence from actors and knowingly accepting these to be true, this is obsurd. This author has lost complete credibility, and at this point is just writing for some obscure purpose.Lastly, this book heavily references scientific case studies, but yet employs a TV sitcom in the same manner, which is a disservice to science.

  I have liked his earlier books better. This one has a slow start and those reviewers who gave up after a few chapters (I nearly did so myself) would get more value by going all the way through. (For example one reviewer discussed the Bland case and indicated that Gladwell was blaming the policeman, which accusation totally misses the point and is totally inaccurate when you read to the end. )This book tracks several lines of inquiry and multiple case histories but interleaves them in a way that inhibits the flow. I found that this approach to construction of the book made the book much longer than it needed to be and lessened the value of the experience. If you are just starting to read Gladwell's works don't start with this book.

  Malcolm Gladwell is a cross between a storyteller and a journalist.  He digs up stories to support his theories.  Each book he has written has multiple themes and theories.  This one is a bit different.  It focuses on how difficult it is to talk to strangers and get a true understanding of the person’s thinking, morals and philosophies.  Unfortunately, he doesn’t have advice on how to get better at it.He tells the stories of how judges grant bale who probably should have remained in jail, about Hitler’s intentions; how Bernie Madoff deceived smart individuals who thought he was a genius and Knox served prison time for a murder that she did not commit.Gladwell tells us that we are poor judges of when bad people are putting on an act, yet we believe we are good at sizing up a person.Gladwell fans will like this book. Those who have never been exposed to his work, and even some of his regular readers, might wonder, “Is that all there is?”  I wanted a bit more.

  I expected the pseudo-scientific hypotheses supported by little more than anecdotes, but I did not expect things to go so backward, like when Gladwell tacitly suggests Jerry Sandusky was falsely accused, absolves the Penn State administrators of their failings, and kind of blames the parents for being deceived by Larry Nassar because we ""default to truth.""It's obvious to the point of common sense that people tend to believe others. It seems to me that his ""default to truth"" maxim oversimplifies these terribly complex situations. Gladwell, however, jettisons the nuance and frames the anecdotes in the book as clear examples where our ""default to truth"" is the culprit—just take his word for it. I'm not so sure he has met the burden of proof.Edit: Also, Gladwell never establishes a clear position on whether ""default to truth"" is good or bad. Early in the book, he uses the above examples (and others) to show that ""default to truth"" can be problematic. But he ties the introduction about Sandra Bland's fate to an example where police officers' training to AVOID defaulting to truth has led to the poor relations between police and the public. In this case, it seems to have precipitated Sandra Bland's suicide. If the point is simply that our ""default to truth"" is neither good nor bad, then I struggle to understand the point of this book.

  Terrible book, not worth the paper it is printed on.  For many years I've enjoyed the insight of Malcolm Gladwell, but not this time.  It is terrible to think that a heretofore respected social commentator would stoop examining the antics of Jerry Sandusky just to sell books.  This is not social examination, just further exploitations of a very dark incident in the lives of many that were innocent.  Pedophilia is ugly in all forms, and exploiting's it for books sales is concomitant to those that were invited to the front row seats of the Roman Coliseum to watch the most gruesome  aspects of humanity in blood sport.  No thank you Mr. Gladwell.  You are capable of better social commentary than this.  And to those who have not read the book, be warned that will be taken to the darkest and vilest filth of society.  At least the book is appropriately titled.  When we were young we were taught not to talk to strangers, and when we are older we are advised not to read about those that do.

  This book has its moments, but suffers frequently in my opinion substantively..We begin with “Default To Truth” a fanciful phrase for what is taught in Psych I.People generally believe what they want to believe..to which psychiatrists wouldadd..what they have to believe..We want to believe that people are telling us thetruth, or, more precisely, what they understand to be true..Nothing new here at all.This easily explains in general terms the examples of Hitler, the Queen of Cuba, andnumerous other situations explored..The additional stories of judges assessing bail andthe Sandusky case, are clothed in a legal overlay of rights and exposures to liability, withdown the road exposure to charges of defamation particularly as to Sandusky, which theauthor largely ignores..Both as to Sandusky and Brock Turner and Emily Doe, we are dealingwith judges and juries making determinations not because anybody ultimately knew thetruth about strangers but because the legal system demanded an outcome..whether true orjust or not..The Amanda Knox illustration teaches us next to nothing..about dealing with or believing strangers..Knox was unlikely a murderess from the get go..But she was great tabloid fodder..To label her as immatureand flaky would be an act of kindness..She was young and beautiful..That always gets things going..But the“transparency” adopted as described in the behavior of the lead prosecutor and his off the wall rationalizationfor a conviction reflects stupidity in the extreme..The reference to television in general and “Friends” in particularsays more about television actors exaggerating facial and body language to make sure the audience “gets it” thanany principle called “transparency.”We come back to the initial example of Sandra Bland and Officer Brian Encinitas..Without detailing, here we have a perfect stormfor disconnects because aside from all that is stated on the pages, most significant to me, to start and end with, is an adversarialsituation, where a ticket happy traffic patrolman in a Texas outpost confronts an educated Black woman, where the strangerstalk to each other with little to no communication..Yes..believing strangers is the more comfortable way to carry on the business of life..And it soothes our egos to firmly assessour persona as unworthy of being duped or treated in any way aside from above board..The price we pay seems quite small

  I always look forward to reading Malcolm Gladwell's books, because I never fail to learn new things. When I saw that his latest book was entitled ""Talking To Strangers,"" I assumed that it might include research into the most effective ways to reach out to strangers in social settings. I quickly learned that the scope of his work here is much broader than that. He addresses the many ways in which we fail to read signals from strangers about who they are and what they are thinking and feeling.As he always does, the author draws from a broad spectrum of real world settings to discuss the principles of communication and miscommunication that are the norm in today's world.  A through thread in this book is the case of Sandra Bland. This African American woman from Chicago was in Prairie View, Texas interviewing for a job at the local university. As she was driving away from the campus, she was pulled over by officer Brian Encinia, ostensibly for changing lanes without using her turn signal. The encounter, which should have been innocuous, escalated to the point where she was arrested for failure to comply with the officer's orders. Three days later, she hanged herself in her jail cell. Throughout the book, Gladwell returns to this incident to point out the many levels at which Officer Encinia failed to read correctly the signals that Ms. Bland was sending as she sat in her car, boiling with rage at having been stopped for ""Driving While Black""!Gladwell makes the point, in the the case of Sandra Bland and many others, that we often fail to perceive others correctly because of a mismatch between the signals that the suspect was sending and the interpretation that the officer attributed to those signals. The author eloquently summarizes the dilemma we face in meeting and understanding strangers:""This has been a book about a conundrum.  We have no choice but to talk to strangers, especially in our modern, borderless world. We aren't living in villages any more. Police officers have to stop people they do not know. Intelligence officers have to deal with deception and uncertainty.  Young people want to go to parties explicitly to meet strangers: that's part of the  thrill of romantic discovery. Yet at this most necessary of tasks we are inept. We think we can transform the stranger, without cost or sacrifice, into the familiar and the  known, And we can't. What should we do? (p. 342)Along the way, Gladwell uses a wide variety of case studies: CIA failures to discover a highly placed double agent, enhanced interrogation techniques, police training, date rape at a frat party, Neville Chamberlain's naivete in dealing with Hitler, Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme, Sylvia Plath's suicide, and a murder in Italy - each case highlights the many ways in which we think we know people, but really do not. As he often does, he draws from research in multiple fields: cognitive psychology, sociology, criminology, diplomacy, and economics. The resulting book causes us to rethink how we evaluate the strangers that we meet.Enjoy!

  So many people recommended this book to me, but I hated it. I was drawn in by the stories at first, but by halfway through it didn't seem like he was actually going anywhere, and indeed that turned out to be the case. I started cringing at his description of the Brock Turner and Jerry Sandusky stories, and his take on Sandra Bland's death made me want to throw my phone across the park where I was reading on the Kindle app. All the people involved in these stories are presented more or less as morally neutral, misunderstanding and being misunderstood by others. That's not a brilliant new insight, it's the same old way of approaching power differential situations, and it gives the benefit of the doubt to abusers and their protectors.

  I listen to the RH podcast, and this season was all about this book. If you're heard RH recently, you'd be familiar with about 80% of the book.I get Gladwell's argument that how we talk to strangers is guided by the tendency to default to truth, the transparency fallacy, and failure to account for context (coupling), and the argument is persuasive, but I didn't get a concrete sense of what I should do with that knowledge other than ""being careful"" because talking to strangers can be fraught with misunderstanding, false assumptions, and cluelessness. I'm not sure he knows either.He acknowledges that there are really good reasons for defaulting to the truth and assuming truth; society doesn't function if we don't believe other people or assume everyone is lying to use all the time. However, he points out that the tendency to believe what we're told and the assumption that people's behaviors are accurate indicators of their inner selves leads us to blind ourselves to terrible realities and misread  people with terrible results. We can't do and not do all those things, so I assume what we should do when talking to strangers is do something in between, such as ""default to truthiness"" or ""trust but verify.""I also think many of Gladwell's examples to illustrate his main points are only insightful in hindsight; at the time of all the examples, the people in the situations were defaulting to truth, assuming transparency, and not coupling behavior to context, but I'm not so sure they would have been able to make the opposite choices given the context. His critique in those situations was, ""they shouldn't have done that,"" but if they took his advice, they might not have been heard.Like I said, great insights on an important and pressing larger social problem today, but not very helpful on suggestions for how to move beyond defaulting to truth, how to not assume transparency, or how to correctly couple behavior to context.

  Book is all over the place and he misses his own point.  Both parties are Strangers in his examples not just the office or the person in control. Understanding Strangers goes both ways.All the chapters are interesting but claiming they are all related is a stretch.Not up to his usual high standard. I own all his books.

  Malcolm Gladwell is such an interesting writer, not only for the subjects he chooses to write about, but for the unique perspective he takes in his exploration of them.  I found myself scratching my head more than once while reading this one, and also engaging in quite a bit of self-reflection on my own interactions with others, whether they be strangers or not.  If you like having your brain adjusted and your world view challenged, this is a great read.

  This author is so overrated. In this book he posits that people in the majority need to ""understand"" people in the minority. Nice as far as it goes, but even in the examples he gives (which he treats fairly) the counterposition is striking: ""Hey, minority person who lives in the U.S. - get with the program and act like an American!"" Why should the people in the majority have to defer to the people in the minority who obstinately refuse to act in a traditional American fashion? (Who defines this fashion? Historical fact). What you do in the privacy of your own home, or among people who are like you, is your own business. But when you enter the public arena, the public rules govern - that is, the rules of the majority.For example, why should the white cop, paid for by tax dollars, have to listen patiently to a tirade by a black person who is not following orders that cops typically give? White people and successful minorities usually just do what cops say, and if they don't, they too get shot (sometimes in misunderstanding). Minorities who revel in their subculture need to do this also to avoid getting shot. It's that simple. No further understanding needed. The example of the successful black woman who was shot by the cop? Well here she did not act like the college professor she was. College professors don't act like that, it's not the cop's fault (and if they do, they get shot, white or black. Duh!)""Victims"" need to stop putting themselves in positions that statistically lead to victim-hood. it's the advice any rational parents teach their children. Stay out of harm's way.The author should write a sequel where the person in authority is the stranger.

  Although I have read several Malcolm Gladwell books, this one just didn't meet the expectations.  It seemed like Gladwell just wrote a book of a few incidents that have happened and he had a personal gripe about how they were handled.  Way too much writing on  simple incidents...I did make it through the whole book but it was a struggle.  Not near the reading quality of Outliers or The Tipping Point...Seemed like Malcolm has an axe to grind.....

  I’m generally a fan of MG. He writes well and is not afraid to back Truth over Political Correctness.But he lost me with this book. He endeavors to explain and shine light upon some of the pitfalls of human communication - but he really just doesn’t deliver. Some of his observations are interesting, but he never ties it all together and in the end he just seems to ramble on about a handful of (exquisitely documented) cases of poor communication over the past century.I sense that Gladwell sometimes takes the unconventional and unpopular view on the topics he analyzes. I’m okay with that. I may not agree with him, but I believe he tries very hard to adhere to the principles of truth and rationality. I just want to be clear that I’m not giving this book a low rating because I was shocked and angered over any of discussion of Sandusky or Madoff etc. I simply didn’t think this book was particularly well-written.

  I thought Talking to Strangers by Malcolm Gladwell was okay.  I have read all of M Gladwell's books and this is my least favorite.  Tipping Point and Outliers are my favorite M Gladwell books.I was confused many times when reading the book.  I almost felt like I missed something in the beginning.  I think if I read the book again, I would get more clarity.  As always, M Gladwell has interesting examples, so the human interest side of the book was there.  I just didn't understand his points about talking to strangers.I would recommend Talking to Strangers to readers who like:  Malcolm Gladwell.

  The format of interspersed stories developed in short sections throughout the chapter was a cute concept and defined the pop-psych genre - maybe it is time to retire it.  This book adopts the same narrative style as MG's previous one, but with much less substance or even a coherent hypothesis to help out.Much of the ""stranger"" discussed here are in somewhat controlled environments - judges, police officers, investigators, etc... - where a context is pre-determined or atleast transparent.  It is not the ""stranger"" the average person runs into on the street or the mall ;  plus,  the narration is entirely biased towards interactions going wrong; no mention of strangers helping others in an accident, disaster relief, etc.  It is also bizarre to see sexual assaults and rape are not primarily seen as just sheer criminal activities but described from ""truth default"" mumbo-jumbo perspective to argue why anyone missed all the red flags (conveniently forgetting hindsight is great).Overall, other than trying to milk earlier successes, all this book does is to tarnish the ""provocateur"" aura MG has tried to build in his previous works.  This is a dud;  wait for the deluge of $1 copies showing up in local library book sales.

  The author jumps around from story to story about miscommunication to make the points that most people tend to give the benefit of the doubt to strangers, that some people are good liars while other people who are innocent appear to act guilty, and that sometimes people are in the wrong place at the wrong time.  If the author had just reported the many stories in whole, then gone on to the next, this reader would have enjoyed hearing about the miscommunications.

  This work by Gladwell talks about how we perceive strangers, which color our subsequent interactions. Some of the people presented in this book are misunderstood and end up committing suicide. Others are crooks and spies who skirted by the justice system. Some others are good at catching spies, but harbor an unhealthy amount of paranoia. Yet others like Jerry Sandusky get by for years without getting caught for their crimes. Either way, we see how the world through a distorted set of lenses, colored by our own prejudices.That's how I would summarize this latest work by Gladwell's. Initially, I was excited when I saw this new release. I like his work because in the past he had been able to main objective and impartial. This time though, he has introduced a ton of personal bias, injecting what looks like his own political viewpoints and agendas. This makes it harder for me to digest and accept the information and accept the arguments for the viewpoints he presents.

  Gladwell meanders around a lot in this book, as he has a tendency to do, and which is usually entertaining.  But in this case, he spends way too much time providing excruciating detail on things I really didn't care about, apparently to make a point about something, which I never quite got.  Spoiler alert: For example, he spends way too much time talking about the history of suicides in London as related to gas lines in homes.  While the initial explanation about the gas lines was interesting, he goes into way too much detail and history to make his point.  He also spend way too much time talking about how people behave when they're drunk.  I'm still not really sure what that issue really had to do with ""talking to strangers.""

  This is a typical Malcolm Gladwell book- well written, fast-paced and entertaining. He succeeds in making the reader think about things from a different perspective and points out things that seem obvious after the fact but are most often overlooked. An example of this is the evidence he presents that shows a critical component for suicidal people is the means to commit suicide. Most people think suicidal people have made up their minds and finding a way to kill themselves is just a side factor, but the data clearly shows this is not the case. Gladwell explains why this makes sense and demonstrates the same principles in other phenomena.He discusses several instances of the dangers of misperceptions and how making assumptions can lead to disastrous consequences. He explores double agents, Bernie Madoff, and Hitler. The biggest value of this book is it deals with a subject that everyone relates to and is presented in a thought-provoking manner. He presents several interesting statistics and most of the stories discussed are familiar to people but his details and analysis provide greater depth.I gave this book 3 stars and almost stopped reading it because of what I thought was unnecessary descriptions and details. He provides lengthy, graphic descriptions of a few of the cases, including the well-known and stomach churning disgusting spectacle named Jerry Sandusky, as well as a college rape incident. Maybe it's just me, but these two sections really detracted from the overall presentation. The ending does tie everything together and demonstrate in concrete terms the consequences of his theory so I'm glad I finished, but I would have to rank this as his lowest based on my previous comments. But, like all his books, they are well researched and it's great there are people like him to condense a lot of information and present it in a clear manner.

  I enjoy reading Gladwell.  Most of the time I read nonfiction to see what ideas the author has and how they might compare with my own thinking.  That is easy to do with this book because he goes into great detail about the people and situations. There is a pretty scathing review in the Atlantic Monthly today which suggests that Malcom's peddling of social science has reached its own tipping point (not much left to offer).  It is probably true that Malcolm is too trusting of social science research which is often nothing more than commonly understood ideas dressed up with fancy language, or simply shoddy thinking and research that was good enough for an academic journal (though there are exceptions). Social science is a mess, but the behavior is still interesting to think about, and when reading Gladwell you can disagree or come up with your own ideas about what's actually going on.  No harm in that.

  My first book of 2020. I am a neurotic introvert, so this book title gave me a quick sting of anxiety. Luckily, it wasn’t what I was expecting; it wasn’t a self-help book about how to practice your way into extroversion. Having read Tipping Point and Blink, I hoped this new effort from Gladwell would provide a similar pop-science look at a fascinating aspect of our culture that is often overlooked. It didn’t do that, either. Instead it starts with a story of a tragic encounter between a policeman and an unarmed person of color. How did their communication break down so completely that this woman ended up dead as a result of a traffic stop?Gladwell uses this story as a backdrop for further conversation on the difficulty of communicating with strangers and the common assumptions and pitfalls into which we all stumble. The discussion doesn’t seem to break much new ground, but Gladwell is articulate and his argument is clear. I finished this book with a shrug and a quick scramble to find my next book. I wasn’t left with any deep or troubling truths to reflect upon and I didn’t feel the guttural  pull of the injustice described in the book. Perhaps Gladwell’s natural style--relaxed but informed, provocative but safe, relevant but untimely--works against him in this book. Instead of offering answers to problems, Gladwell presents a series of “what if” hypotheticals that do not seem to directly address the real communication problems described. Communication is tricky. That’s the whole of this book. Gladwell shares some fun anecdotes and some tragic stories but the book feels rushed to production and amorphous in message.C

  Gladwell writes an interesting and informative book that keeps the reader engaged from the first page.  It begins by showing us that we often misinterpret the behavior of strangers, even though we often think that we get it right. This is as true for ordinary people as for police and others who think they really understand human behavior.  At the same time, Gladwell shows that people are often coupled to places, and the context of places and situations can often be a reliable way to overcome the weaknesses of our predictions.  Gladwell uses a fascinating set of social science research to make his point, and he focuses in particular on the world of policing, where the consequences of misinterpreting strangers can have particularly troubling outcomes.  Here he not only draws on cutting edge criminological research, he leads us to a new way of thinking about what the police should be doing.  They should be limiting their contacts with strangers, by focusing in on those places where crime is concentrated in a city (just a small percentage of streets).  This insight is a fundamental one and can help not only to reduce the troubling negative consequences of policing, but can also lead to communities that see policing as legitimate.

  Oh man, this book is ridiculously cringe-y. Malcolm Gladwell clearly knows very little about human interaction and has no business writing a book about it. He shows results from a poll where people have different conclusions about what constitutes consent and concludes that ""there are no rules"" when it comes to consent -- umm no.He also thinks that the (extremely obvious) conclusion that communication is more confusing when both parties are drunk is somehow revelatory.  His conclusion about the Brock Turner situation is that ""we know that our mistaken belief that people are transparent leads to all manner of problems between strangers. It leads us to confuse the innocent with the guilty and the guilty with the innocent."" But the Brock Turner situation is not a communication problem -- it's someone who either doesn't understand or doesn't care that what they're doing is wrong because there's idiots like Malcolm Gladwell telling people that there are ""no rules"" about consent. Sorry Malcolm and Brock, there are rules and if you break them you belong in jail.There are so many more cringey and questionable statements in this book I have no clue why no one stopped him from publishing this.

  I was excited to see a new book from MG. He has a comfortable-to-read style and he poses intriguing questions. Even though he never answers the intriguing questions, I have still enjoyed his books, until now.He totally missed the point of the Jerry Sandusky and Dr. Nassar atrocities. The delay of action in those atrocities had very little to do with our psychological prejudice towards ignoring the bad. The delay of action was 99% about knowingly and criminally hiding the bad to protect the ""institutions"" ie. Penn State Univ. and Mich. State Univ.MG's erroneous and lurid venture into the Sandusky and Nassar atrocities showed that he has become a tabloid author seeking to fill column space contract obligations.I returned the book for a refund.

  This book defines a problem and offers several examples of the problem but clearly, through the use of the author’s emotional voice, takes sides.

  I totally understand why some people do not like Malcolm Gladwell.  First of all, he’s very successful, which invites backlash.  On a fairer note, despite the confidence with which he presents his work, it often comes across as vague and inconclusive.  He also gives the impression of cherry-picking information to create an engrossing through-line (though I find this to be a problem with many writers these days).This particular book—on the difficulties of dealing with strangers—exacerbates many of these defects.  On the one hand, it is an interesting issue for modern times.  It wasn’t that long ago that most of us wouldn’t come across that many strangers in a lifetime, living our lives close to where we were born.  Now, with the mobility of travel for vacations as well as life moves and, more importantly, that boon/curse of the Internet, most of us have to deal with strangers all the time.  And, as Mr. Gladwell points out, most of us simply don’t do it very well.As usual, Mr. Gladwell’s book is filled with numerous anecdotes that illustrate the pet theories he’s intent on letting us know about.  On the other hand, it is more difficult in this book to understand exactly how what he is telling us will help us deal more effectively with the problem.I happen to like Mr. Gladwell’s work.  Of course, I probably don’t take it as seriously as he would like.  What I enjoy is his engaging writing style and his ability to get me to think about things in a new way.  I don’t always agree with his conclusions, but I like the way he opens my eyes to ideas I wouldn’t have necessarily thought about otherwise.  For that, I am always grateful to him.

  I loved Outliers and Blink but now I feel I have to go back and re-read them in a more critical fashion.I suspect this was ghost written, and not the true work of Malcolm Gladwell, or if he wrote it, he should be more careful.  I finished it scratching my head to find the point of it.  There are many logical errors in it.His teaser that he starts with and slightly weaves throughout the book and dives deeper at the very end is the proverbial story of a white cop and black suspect/victim.  We all know there is going to be a bad outcome with this description, but he makes it seem like the direct cause of the bad outcome was the cop.  The cop was a well intended policeman who had very bad methods.  The suspect/victim could have very easily just let things ride and eventually enjoy a six or seven figure lawsuit against this police department. Instead, the suspect/victim with likely a past history of Borderline Personality Disorder reacts in a way to generate her own bad outcome.  The direct cause of the bad outcome was hers alone, yet Gladwell uses this as an example, a very convenient and politically correct example, but it is illogical.  The beginning of his book he suggests that we err in our interactions with strangers because we ""default to the truth"", which our habitual or instinctual wanting to trust people can get us into trouble when we interact with strangers.  YET, he concludes the book not reinforcing this premise but contradicting it, as he closes with the suggestion that we need to ""default to the truth"".  So which is it, Malcolm?Another example of poor logic is that he uses an example, I'm not sure what for exactly, of how enhanced interrogation techniques for terrorists lead to bad data because the psychological trauma generated can greatly affect a person's memory recall.  That seems like a reasonable hypothesis.  But he oddly uses as an example KSM, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed - the 9-11 mastermind, and he suggests that the enhanced interrogation technique of waterboarding is not effective because its too traumatizing.  Yet he describes in detail how KSM was able to open up his sinuses and allow the water pouring on him to escape, and that KSM recognized the timing of the waterboarding and would use his fingers to count down how many seconds remained with the water torture, in essence that waterboarding was not at all intimidating to KSM.  So why use an example of non-traumatic interrogation to make a point about traumatic interrogation??  He then goes on to describe how KSM later confesses to dozens of terrorist actions and plots with Gladwell suggesting that KSM likely could not have been involved in all the terrorist actions he confessed to, suggesting (but not stating) that possibly KSM's memory was altered by interrogation that he earlier describes in detail how non-traumatic it was for KSM.He makes a politically correct but illogical suggestion that crime is related to guns, and that to reduce crime you have to reduce guns in certain areas or types of people, and to reduce guns, you have to implement more traffic stops for moving violations including minor and irrelevant ones - in specific areas of high crime, and use those traffic stops to somehow (he doesn't explain how) find and confiscate guns which reduces crime in those areas, but this only works in areas of high crime concentration in Kansas City but has not been replicated anywhere else.  ???  What is the point??His examples are just logically confusing as to what point he's trying to make, and I finished the book no wiser.  This is in stark contrast to his other books that I felt slightly wiser after reading them and presented very logical arguments.As a result, I have had to apologize to my girlfriend who when I first starting reading this, voiced her negative opinion of him and his arguments, which led to me arguing with her, as I did really enjoy his other books.  But my girlfriend was right - this book is unfortunately illogical, confusing and pointless.  I give it two stars because I did finish it (unfortunately) and I only reserve 1 star for reviews on books that are so horrible I cant even finish them.Good luck reading this yourself!  Hopefully you'll have a better experience than I did

  I have unequivocally loved every other Malcolm Gladwell book I’ve read except this one.  I think the policing analysis of the Sandra Bland case and other cases is right on.  As usual Mr. Gladwell’s analysis is spot on and very informative.I disagree wholeheartedly with the analysis that Graham Spanier was duped by Jerry Sandusky. The investigation of  the matter by former FBI Director Louis Freeh concluded that Paterno, Spanier, Curley and Shultz had know about the allegations of sexual abuse by Sandusky since 1998 and did nothing about it.  The case against Spanier was overturned on a technicality.  Spanier, like the leaders in the Catholic Church child sexual abuse scandal, was protecting the institution.  He is most certainly not the kind of person I want heading an institution teaching our young people.Regarding the Fraternity Party chapter, I’m left shaking my head.

  I was disappointed reading this book.  I expected more from Gladwell.  He appears to ignore the historical contexts of most of his examples of stranger misreads, only offering a more extensive explanation in the footnotes section of the book.  Who, aside from me, reads the footnotes at the back of the book?  It was reductionistic and based on limited science--ignoring the longer historical context of racism, sexism, and monetary gain upon which most of his ""misunderstandings"" are based.  Did Gladwell ever stop to ask:  what were the secondary gains made by those in his examples?  If he did, I didn't read about it.  A big disappointment and it lowered my opinion of Gladwell.

  Within the first couple of pages the writers twisted bias was displayed. He used the word “allegedly” regarding the Ferguson incident about Michael Brown robbing a store, when in fact it’s on YouTube with him doing it. He also made Brown appear as a choir boy, he was with gangs for years. Also, if a cop asked you to step out of a car, comply. You don’t have a legal right to fight with a cop. Malcom is just writing a book to profit from the ignorant who fail to question his motives

  Malcolm Gladwell makes a simple point that a lot of rape cases are in the context of excessive drug and alcohol abuse. An altered state of mind, by definition, will make you unable to show physical discomfort or resistance because you're literally not conscious, even though your eyes are open and you're talking. He then uses a series of experiments and anecdotes to show how a lack of resistance can be misinterpreted by the other partner as consent.Ultimately, his point is not that revolutionary--be careful with getting drunk and high and then being around strangers in a highly charged, semi-anonymous and sexualized environment.For making this point he has been skewered, accused of defending rape culture and of trying to excuse the behavior of rapists.No, this is not what he's doing. Rather, as is typical for Gladwell, he's simply pointing out that ""consent"" is not binary -- there are many shades of grey. History will be kinder to this text than the criticism of this temporary hysteria.

  I didn’t agree with everything Gladwell concludes based on his extensive evidence. However, like all of Gladwell’s books, it made me take on a new perspective. The best feature of the book is the style of flow, which keeps you engaged. I felt like I could read the book cover to cover in one sitting.I also thought he did a good job at attempting to recognize and remove biased viewpoints throughout. I’m a huge supporter of our peace officers and I appreciated the way he broke down the situation objectively. This is another Gladwell classic, sure to bring the coupling perspective to countless other fields.

  Malcolm Gladwell is one of my favorite writers. He has a sure eye for picking up the matters to dig into. “Talking To Strangers” takes up ‘Black Lives Matter’ case for discussion. His attitude is neither looking down at the case from ten thousand feet nor examining details with a magnifying glass. Standing on victims’ point of view, he considers better ways to approach strangers. If we were more thoughtful as a society, were willing to engage in some soul-searching manner, he thinks, we could avoid miseries. The book is an antithesis of his former book, “Blink.” “Blink” dissects the case from assailants’ point of view. On “Blink,” Gladwell induces us importance of adaptive unconscious. He writes decisions made very quickly could be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately. We can know more about someone or something in the blink of an eye. However, sometimes, there is a case when rapid cognition leads us astray. He asserts our snap judgment and first impressions can be educated and controlled. As our first impressions are generated by our experiences and our environment, we can alter the way we thin-slice by changing the experiences that comprise those impressions. He concludes we need to take a balance between deliberate and instinctive thinking.On “Talking To Strangers,” he points out, meeting a stranger sometimes leads us to wrong direction in making sense of that person than not meeting them. Why can’t we detect a lie of a stranger facing with us? Gladwell brings three points, something wrong with us.1) a default to truth: We live on basic assumption that the people are honest. We never developed sophisticated and accurate skills to detect deception in the process of evolution. There has been no advantage to spending our time scrutinizing the words and behaviors of those around us.2) transparency: We believe that people’s demeanor is a reliable guide to their emotions and character. But, the thing we want to learn about stranger is fragile. He warns, if we tread carelessly, it will crumple under our feet. With caution and humility is the right way to talk to strangers.3) coupling: A stranger’s behavior is tightly connected to place and context, is linked to very specific circumstances and conditions. We need to look at the stranger’s world, without looking at the stranger and jumping to conclusions.He says what is required of us is restraint and humility. He stresses attending to strangers requires care and attention. When we can aufheben, or transcend, what is written on these two books, we can build a better society.

  Author Malcom Gladwell has a way to scratch much deeper into the surface of topics that have provoked the mind and encouraged an array of discussion.  One can say that most of the books that he has written up to ""Talking to Strangers:  What We Should Know About The People We Do Not Know"" possess the quality of analysis.  Gladwell offers a critical eye for the topics that he writes within his books and for this one, the title speaks loudly as well as the contents within it.""Talking to Strangers"" is written in five parts and centers upon the most recent high profile incidents that have and continue to reverberate within current news and events that are shaping modern history as well parallel with events that have already occurred that are relevant and have shaped history.  For readers that are familiar to Gladwells's books, many may also be familiar with his podcast ""Revisionist History""; tinges of this books resonate in tone and content.  And what readers new or old will find interesting -- Gladwell tends to always mesh history with other fields of study from psychology and sociology and science and analytic thinking.  The first chapter sets the stage of the book that follow with proceeding chapters with a series of cases that each have in common -- to find understanding amidst misunderstandings; Gladwell writes with clarity and details that point to queues of verbal and non-verbal and body language that had been exhibited with the individuals involved in each case.  He provides enlightening explanations that spring from thought-provoking and at times confronting uncomfortable issues.  He attempts to present both sides of the stories -- perspectives that take the evidence and unwraps it all from inside and out.  There are several examples and topics that range to the most recent such as Sandra Bland to Amanda Knox to events and individuals to the ancient past such as the periods of conquest and brothers of the Ottoman Empire to encounters between Cortes and Montezuma.After reading ""Talking to Strangers,"" readers will find Gladwell puts into perspectives topics that have drummed up continued discussion.  And after discussion, more questions and discussion may arise, especially if it is coming from a Gladwell book.

  The author uses well-know case studies to make his points, starting and ending with the arrest of Sandra Bland and running through Cold War CI failures, Chamberlain's engagement with Hitler, Madoff, Sandusky, date rape, post-9/11 interrogation, Sylvia Plath, and LE crime analysis.The one substantial fault I find is that in his arguing for the concept of default to truth.  Although I do find some validity in it, the examples he provides are all colored by authority bias - which by itself can have a significant impact on receptive belief.  In a bit of irony, in a book that argues for understanding context in interactions with strangers, in this bit on ""default to truth"" he avoids context which would weaken his presentation of that concept.  And in his discussion of both the intelligence and the law enforcement examples, I perceive he is too dismissive of the role of experience and professional competence, or the lack thereof, with his discussion a bit too focused on support for the concept the book is pushing.  Understandable to a degree, but I feel that by avoiding that piece of the discussion it weakens rather than strengthens his argument.On the other hand, his discussion of transparency / coupling / mismatching is very good, and put in an easily understood casual way of explanation that could serve as a useful reference in HUMINT training.  The same goes for the discussion of the counterproductive nature of coercive interrogation still struggling against the myth of its efficacy.  Finally, the section discussing hot spot policing is touches a chord, as it practical effectiveness has long been understood and there is a tremendous amount of information and training available focused on the methods of processes, but in far too many jurisdictions it is either ignored, misused, or simply incompetently managed in application.In any case, a recommended read for anyone who actually has to interact with other human beings in a professional capacity which could result in any sort of dispute or misunderstanding.

  I may have initially misunderstood the intent of this book.  I thought maybe it was a book on making small talk with strangers which I feel, I probably rank in the lower 20% of the human race in doing.  I have a lot of silence when forced to be alone with someone I don't know, unless they are unusually willing to carry a higher initial burden of small talk.When I realized this wasn't a book about small talk, I went ahead, and hung on for the ride anyway.  I had read Malcolm Gladwell's book ""Outliers"" maybe ten years ago.  And I loved that book, and thought it had many great insights.""Talking to Strangers"" is a book about us not being able to effectively read the intent of people who are strangers to us.  He quotes us some incidents or case studies that are interesting about how it's hard for all people to tell when a stranger is lying to them; and about how policing methods that work in one city or area of a city may be successful because they fit the need of where they originated, but can be an utter failure when they are tried in another city in another situation.Some interesting things in the book, for sure.  But I didn't like this one as well as ""Outliers"" because he didn't seem to reach a solution, or an idea for a solution to our problems communicating and reading the intent of others.  Overall, I came away feeling that I read a book that said, ""Hey!  We have trouble communicating, and reading each other's intent.""  And I have known this for over half of my life.

  I'm recommending this book to everybody.  As somebody who feels like he is smothered in ""this culture doesn't understand that culture"" tirades and finger pointings, this book does an EXCEPTIONAL job of explaining why certain groups of people see the world one way while another sees it a different way... and that sometimes leads to destructive clashes.  This book sheds light on this super sensitive topic with an objectivity and respectfulness that is sorely lacking in our world because it is all done with fact and data and NO OVERT AGENDA.  Actual reportage is so uncommon these days!  Gladwell is successful at handling cultural issues because I think it's not the intent of the book (I don't think!) but rather it just shows why people perceive things the way they do and how things can go wrong when oftentimes artificial skews are injected into the equation.  The whole culture clash issue is a natural part of the book's discussion, but not the only point of it.  For instance, Gladwell does the best job of exploring ""Enhanced Interrogation Techniques"" that I've seen, as well as discussion on ""how to tell if somebody is lying to you.""  So it's not all about culture!  Nonetheless, take all your ""sensitivity training"" ideas and throw them in the trash-- just read this book.  Seriously, it's all you have to do.

  I read the entire book, even the footnotes. It's surprising that some reviewers were very negative. I found the book eyeopening. The premise of the book is that we jump to conclusions either positive or negative based on automatic thinking. I was aware of many of the events discussed in the book, and for some I already had a strong opinion about guilt or innocence, but the discussions view events in a different light. The narrative of the book has me realizing how important it is to understand all the facts and to set aside a knee-jerk conclusion.Having said that, I'm about to give a knee-jerk opinion: I wonder if the negative reviewers have a political agenda or an ax to grind?

  I usually really like Malcolm Gladwell but this book disappointed me. The premise interested me. I was hoping for insight into interactions between different people, especially in today’s emotionally charged climate. I kept reading thinking he was going to get to some kernel to help me understand. He did not, in any of the scenarios he presented. I particularly didn’t like the way the book ended. Blame was shifted to someone that certainly didn’t deserve it. Because she “didn’t like police officers”.  Really?  That’s what you leave your readers with?I expected better of Malcolm Gladwell. This book left me angry as well as disappointed. This book is going in the trash where it belongs.

  Malcolm Gladwell is a redux of great pop psychology books from the '80's to suit a new generation of millennials.  It's refreshing to read these books to get an unorthodox view of seeing a problem in modern society and to get a glimpse of how and why our improvident decisions are made on a course of action that ends up being a boondoggle of a mess.  Talking to Strangers recurring motifs are transparency of strangers can be misleading, coupling of crime to a place and defaulting to the truth.  The biggest take I got from this, which actually my father would chide to me and tried to instill in me at a young age, was that there is a time and place for everything.  To have that judgement to know when to and where to do something is to be strived for rather than foolishly sticking to one point of view all the time is the dialectic of the philosophy seeking imbued in this book.  To really understand a stranger is to go beyond the comity of formal conversations to a judgement of place, context, and time before defaulting to the truth.

  Gladwell took a major risk in focusing on stories 'ripped from the headlines', since his descriptions and comments often didn't align with what readers knew (or thought they knew) about the events.I was particularly interested in the Brock Turner chapter, as he highlighted what I thought at the time has been underreported - both Brock and Ms Doe were very drunk.  The chapter included quite a bit of new-to-me information about the effects of alcohol.The chapter on spies was very disconcerting.  As was  the chapter on interrogating terrorists albeit for different reasons.

  Interesting and readable but the whole Brock Turner section is ridiculous. It seems to be indicating that maybe they were like crossed wires or confusion or Brock Turner accidentally raped that girl. How about Brock Turner is just a rapist? He obviously knew the girl was unconscious, he tried to run when someone witnessed it. But the author is bending over backwards to give this guy a pass.

  I just finished reading this book and have no idea what it was about.  I have all of Gladwell's books and have reread them a few times, they are so good and enlightening.  This one, however, is an exception.  He does not live up to his usual broad look at things but instead, rambles on without considering all angles of a situation.  The Bland story leaves out what we are always told if stopped by a police officer.  Do what you are told and don't get angry even if you think you are right and he is wrong.  There must have been a whole lot of other issues for Bland that she hanged herself.  Many people get thrown into jail who should not necessarily have been but are not suicidal.  I feel sorry for her that her life was a mess but she is not alone.  A variety of circumstances was making her life unpleasant but there is hope that it will turn out okay.  Gladwell forgets that Bland was a stranger, too.  She may not have a written rule book how to deal when stopped by an officer like he was trained to do, but there is also common sense, stranger or no stranger.This book was just as if Gladwell had a lot of stories to tell through his doing research and he was trying to make them connect.  It didn't work.  I am not going to give up on Gladwell but will check his books out at the library for now on instead of purchasing them.

  The stories were interesting and made me think about how people communicate. I think it was a mistake for the author to try to deal with an aspect of human behavior and racism in one book. Racism is a loaded subject of its own complexity. It overwhelmed the intended aspect of human behavior. I hope to never be involved in the scenarios depicted in the book. It was mostly about crime and the prosecution of it. I can see why the book was written about these events. The events are well documented and life-changing for those involved. I would be more interested in day to day communications. Communicating with friends and family is of more interest to me than crime stories. The book was entertaining but I don't see and Nobel Prize coming for psychological research. The part I liked best was describing the trade-off between defaulting to believing a stranger versus always being suspicious. It seems we must accept some risk n dealing with others. We evolved that way. It works so far anyway. However, I am quite skeptical of what I read on social media and intend to stay that way.

  Having read and loved Gladwell’s books “Blink” and “The Tipping Point,” I asked for this oner for Christmas. It may be his best yet. Gladwell goes into why we are so bad at detecting liars and truth tellers, including by trained people like police and the FBI. He goes through the cases of Amanda Knox, Bernie Madoff, and Anas Montes, the Cuba spy who was a senior analyst with the Defense Intelligence Agency. He also talks about the suicides of poets Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton. He says (and the VA agrees) that if you take away the means, the person will not necessarily find another way to kill themselves. Both women put their heads in the over when Britain was using coal gas containing deadly CO. When they switched to North Sea Gas, the suicide rate dropped sharply. This was a fascinating book and I highly recommend it.Robert A. HallAuthor: The Coming Collapse of the American Republic

The author seems to take this very approach to book layout.Valid points and vignettes could be addressed in a lengthy New Yorker magazine style article.

  Gladwell's book raises a few interesting questions and he substantiates his viewpoint with a few limited cases.I feel he presents it as factual when it's most definitely not clear cut in any sense.The book was an interesting read on what felt like his personal musings on the topic. He also favors the ""victim"" sandra's bland , where realistically she could just as easily have diffused the situation through being less confrontational and belligerent. Not too surprised when I read she had similar issues and thousands of dollars in unpaid fines from previous police encounters.The author also conveniently ignores the fact that police officers are often faced with very real threats and violence, their default to suspicion is not merely a result of training but more so one of experience.Most of the cases that involve police shootings start of with someone refusing to co operate and being belligerent. Escalating a normal situation.Interesting perspective, very one sided.

  This is an excellent book - one of my favorites by Gladwell and one I find referencing in conversation months later. I enjoyed the author's mix of older (e.g. WWII) examples with contemporary issues in the news (e.g. Sandra Bland's arrest).However, this copy of the book was not in good shape physically. The first thing I noticed was a smudge of black, possibly grease, right on the front cover. The picture is from after i wiped it off but the oil had seeped into the cover. Furthermore, the spine was wrinkled and kind of smashed, not only on the dust jacket but on the actual book underneath.

  Some time ago, on a journey along the east coast of the United States, I arrived at JFK airport in New York on the way to visit some uncles and friends in New Jersey.Looking for alternatives to start knowing New York, I told my friends: ""Instead of starting in 5th Avenue, I will jog in Central Park."" I arrived at the park from New Jersey without passing any type of vehicular congestion and I parked comfortably in one of the park's sidewalks, where I saw rocks for bouldering and horseback riders, then I started jogging next to the largest lagoon’s park and after a while I watched people fishing. Once I finished the run and watched attractions of the park and surroundings, I understood why New Yorkers are so proud of their cosmopolitan city.In this very interesting city, and here I make the link with the reason for this post, is where Malcolm Gladwell lives, the prolific and successful writer born in England, who grew up in rural Canada and who is also a New Yorker staff writer several years ago, so I have no doubt that many of his stories are conceived and influenced by his origins and the life he leads in New York, in addition to his excellent handling of pop-science, which makes us understand scientific concepts in an easy way.His latest success ""Talking to Strangers"" is a book on communications, studies facts and customs that lead him to conclude that in the world we have basically two visions to relate to strangers, one is the default to true and the other the default to false and highlights that human beings believe by default too much, often with tragic results.Some excerpts from the book:“The right way to talk to strangers is with caution and humility.”“Don’t look at the stranger and jump to conclusions. Look at the stranger’s world. ”“Because we do not know how to talk to strangers, what do we do when things go awry with strangers? We blame the stranger. ”It is not surprising that Amazon classifies the book in the category of “Business & Money”, it provides us with tools to deal with customers we do not know, new suppliers, new competitors and even to link with regulatory entities with which we have not worked beforeA reading to learn and enjoy!

  This is not so dissimilar from Gladwell’s past work, but it seems somewhat more tentative in its conclusions.

  Malcolm takes on famous examples of default to truth, transparency, and coupling, with typical astute brilliance. This was his most difficult read in the sense of the gut wrenching notoriety of his choices:  Amanda Knox, Jerry Sandusky, Sylvia Plath, Sandra Bland. After reading with relish, many times, his five previous masterful works, I say without reservation this tops them all. The amount of research that went into this book was surely phenomenal. And on a more personal note, I give him great credit on dedicating his latest effort to his deceased father. Bravo in all aspects, Malcolm Gladwell.

  In typical Gladwell fashion, Talking to Strangers seamlessly combines insights from the social sciences with compelling stories.  It focuses more on highly controversial situations than some of his other books, leading to a more emotional, and at times divisive, book.  Overall, though, Gladwell does a commendable job explaining how we so often misinterpret the actions and intentions of strangers and the devastating impacts associated with it.  Notably, these struggles extend beyond the day-to-day interactions of ordinary people that can go awry, instead pervading international relations (e.g., Chamberlain misunderstanding Hitler's intentions), the criminal justice system (e.g., judges making poorer decisions than algorithms despite having access to additional information) and even financial markets (e.g., investors misjudging Bernie Madoff).Not content to merely apply a new lens to historical, systemic or less controversial issues, Gladwell readily, and at times convincingly, analyzes recent controversies with a surprising perspective.  While I disagreed with some of his interpretations, especially an implied dichotomy between the need to either ""default to truth"" or be plagued by paranoia, I appreciated his perspective.  I also learned a lot more about recent controversies in the process.  Overall, I appreciated Gladwell's attempt to broaden our thinking without shying away from controversy.  If you appreciate Gladwell's work and can view emotional situations with some equanimity, I think you'll enjoy this book.

  I have been looking forward to reading ""talking to Strangers"" for awhile.  I have like Malcom Gladwell's other books.  He brings an interesting perspective and writes in a very accessible style.  The problem with this book and some of his others, he is incredibly repetitive.  He just keeps coming back to the same event over and over without adding any new insight.  For example, he starts the book with the Sandra Bland case.  It's a great example of people just talking past each other.  he then returns to this story and goes into more and more depth.  I did a search for the name and there are 38 instances throughout the entire book (every section).  I recommend the book for people who are able to skim through boring sections.  It are not any earth shattering revelations, but it does make you think about how we all communicate with each other.

  This book confirms the brilliance of Malcolm Gladwell's work. Each of his stories in the book will grab your attention. Once you start the book it will be difficult to put down.  I know of few other authors that can write as well as Malcolm does. I think he can make your car's owners manual read like a best seller.The premise of the book evolves around communication patters between strangers. He in a way demonstrates the other side of stories ripped out of the headlines. Through his stories you see how common sense or the ""obvious"" doesn't work even though you think it will. Through that you learn about the difficulty of communication. I highly recommend this book to anyone.

  I thought Malcolm Gladwell's story was a compelling and engaging page turner. It's hard to not give a superior rating but the fact is the story almost tends to be skewed by the perceived authoritative position he takes. He did well to casually mention sources for references without over stating them. I do feel it was best to go short here as too much citing of sources can become boring. I loved the fact that he brings in the many biases inherent in visual interpretation of human behavior and that he's made some very valuable points about institutional disparagement that exists as you read these words. If you find yourself interested in understanding behavior and situational forces you will enjoy reading this story.

  Gladwell is my all-time favorite non-fiction writer.  This book, however, was a great disappointment.  There are three things that we learn: (1) we tend to believe other people, (2) facial expressions don't always tell us what a person is thinking, and (3) what people do depends, in part, on their environment.  Wow.  Who would have though?My impression was that it was a book produced to meet a publisher's deadline...a compilation of past disjoint areas of research (campus sexual assault, suicide, police tactics, etc.) tossed together.  Probably the most disappointing was the inclusion of two sentences claiming benefit to gun bans without any attempt to support or analyze.This is one that even an avid fan could ignore.

  I learned a lot about how cops think. It explained the things that make them suspicious. Good to know. And how their training can cause them to try and push you into letting them search your car. I got a dash cam to protect myself. Also shows how hard it is to truly detect lies. And how many false assumptions are made about how people behave. I might have to read this again. I think it should be required reading for all police officers. They need to quit using traffic stops to look for drugs!

  Seeing a lot of negative post about the book but I found it to be a great read. Gladwell covers some major events within the last 50 years and points to the common human flaws that most fall in to that have enabled these situations. Often I have wondered how some of these events could have even occured when reading of them or listening to the news on TV. Gladwell uses those stories to bring understanding to those who have gone through these encounters. I left the book feeling enlightened, forgiving, and empathetic. Highly recommend the read

  It felt as though it took the author the first 50% of this book to set the stage for the last 50%. While the case studies were interesting and insightful, I grew weary trying to keep all of the “key players” in mind as he went on to prove another, albeit important, aspect of how dismal we are at understanding strangers. Since I’m not a municipal judge, police officer, or elected official — unlikely to turn a communications blunder  into a national scandal or political embarrassment —  I will simply file the book’s information in my “history lessons” drawer. And, who ends a book without at least one summarizing paragraph? Very abrupt.

  It reads like a badly opinionated psychology journal for practitioners in the industry. It's very flawed, and there's a lot of information exaggerated and not conducive to a lot of the same situations he is explaining as fact. This book has ZERO to do with talking to strangers. It hightlights past legal cases in recent history back and forth and that's it. It's all his opinion and small studies he has read. Don't bother.

  Gladwell's book makes some very salient points regarding are lack of ability in reading people who display signals that are contrary to our expectations.  He makes this point using various and diverse examples ranging from professionals and so-called experts to our every-day encounters. I gave it three stars for content but I felt it lacked any substantive remedy for the malady the he so carefully illustrated.  In the end, you are left hanging with the notion that his is who we are and there's not much we can do about it.  It appears from the reading, in fact, that an impersonal AI with some basic data would do a better job of reading people than we would and we could, be handicapping ourselves by using the visual stimulus heralded as the 80 plus percent of non-verbal communication.  An interesting yet incomplete work.

  I realize Gladwell is viewed as a polarizing figure among contemporary thinkers. I read all of his works because he makes me view things differently. I find my self arguing (in a good way) on some of his theories. Talking to Strangers made me think. A lot. What I found lacking was an in-depth analysis of institutional racism and law enforcement. In these times it needs it's own stand alone work. On a personal note, never seeing an episode of Friends left me cold and not caring. I would have chosen a show that crosses demographics.Still, not a waste of time or dollar. I look forward to his next work.

  This book will show police how to better behave when they pull people over and hopefully show those who get pulled over how to better behave.  Discusses  why  most crime is confined to such small geographical areas and how to stop it.  Why people jump off the Golden Gate Bridge and some ways to lower suicide rates. How spies, financial fraudsters and sex offenders get away with it for so long and the nature of the people that uncover their activity.  All of these seemingly far flung subjects are put together in an amazingly cohesive book.  Gladwell once again sheds light on the reasons behind why things are the way they are and the reasons are usually surprising.

  This book is a methodical look at where we often go wrong as a society, in interpreting the behavior of others, particularly when we don't know them that well. At times Gladwell seems like he's straying from his main theme, and sometimes the thread of his logic isn't that obvious, but, by the end of the book, he manages to knit his various threads together into a strong conclusion. It's mainly a cautionary tale about how dangerous our assumptions can be, and a strong argument for paying more attention to our own prejudices and cognitive biases. As a tool for teaching ourselves how to see each other more clearly (and compassionately), those who are ready to take his message to heart will find this a valuable experience.

  While his initial premise and consideration of relations between strangers is interesting, I am unclear about his connections and conclusions. I don't know why he connects the narrative threads that he does (I.e, Sylvia Plath?). He makes the Sandra Bland the focus, but his final pages do not feel thorough enough.

There is a political bias to the left, for sure.  Some sections such as the one on Bernie Madoff are surely a great read, but it didn't add up to something that I was looking for.

  Great concepts on the book. However the author seems to bend a little the conclusions of the book. In my opinion nobody is at fault on the tragic incident that he describes in the beginning of the book. It was a fatality. He describes interesting concepts. he state we should default to the truth, while it is not going to always be the correct approach it saves us cognition. He talks about transparency, which he states it is wrong to assume, that is where I disagree, of course will not always be the correct assumption, but it is the one that will saves us cognition to be able to deal with all the information load in the society. The last concept is about coupling, which states that our behavior depends on context and I completely agree.

  Social science can be boring but this book was riveting. I’ve listened to a few times now and the Cuban double agent story really stuck out to me. How your “..default to truth...” mode allows us to see the good in the world but some things will slip through the cracks was a very good allegory. I’ve not seen the book in print but the soundtrack like  documentary feel of the narrative makes me to only want the audiobook version. There are actual interviews with many of the people quoted and the sound production really sets the tone for some of the material covered. If I could give more stars...

  As always Gladwell gives a unique perspective into an entirely familiar subject. He points out the most critical observations that escape the average person in this screen age. His accounts into each chapter about the individual “Case Studies” blends harmoniously throughout the book; Often highlighting his previous points from other chapters and incorporating them into the next chapters analysis.I highly recommend this book. In today’s society we often forget how to talk to strangers, and casual conversation has been replaced with screen swiping. This action that used to link our humanity to the strangers is lost and is replaced with  anonymity. This in turn begins to invade our off screen time and allows the individual to disassociate themselves from the Strangers plight.This all leads us to where we’re at today; a fractured, polarized society that cannot speak to one another in person.We all need to take a step back and remember we’re all human. We can agree and agree to disagree.

The first topic was on police brutality which initially amused me because of the irony of the situation, then he went on to talk about Hitler, pedophiles, rape, injustice, torture effectiveness and suicides...all very heavy subjects.  I forced myself to finish the book out of principle.  I was looking to escape through reading but this is more of negative subjects we've been bombarded with recently.

  Malcolm Gladwell has a knack for looking at things from a different angle to provide deep insights. He starts with an innocent out of town young black woman who ends up getting imprisoned after an innocent traffic stop. She is so upset, she ends up taking her life in her jail cell. He then digs into the complexity of understanding strangers with an interesting analysis of a few news headlines from the past from double agents to child sex offenders to a wrongful murder conviction. This book is especially insightful today with the recent growth of the BLM movement.

  Malcolm tends to be a binary taste: if you enjoy his work this will be a thought-provoking read. If not, you're likely to flag it as an overly-squishy apology for bad behavior.And there, really, is the book's core theme spelled out: we are far too diverse in thought, opinion, behavior, and motivation to carry around the simple rules of evaluation which we assert are universal.In the analysis of a seemingly-simple case of police abuse Malcolm touches on the nature of lies and spies, of suicide and binge-drinking, to call us all to carpet for the way we think of each other, the way we behave to each other, and the way we deal with the ""abnormal.""When taken with a proper measure of reserve, as all Malcolm's work calls for, Talking to Strangers provides an elegant master-class on human relations with a rich notes section to dive deeper on any parameter he dissects on.

  This is not what I was expecting and not in a flattering way. I am particularly fond of Gladwell's ideas because of his ability to draw research from social psychology in order to justify his theories. The way he draws evidence from the Normal Distribution to understand outliers in his book ""Outliers"". The way he explains research on micro gestures to explain the inner workings of our intuition in his book ""Blink"". This book follows the format of his podcast ""The Revisionist History"" where his focus is less scientific and more anecdotal. He tries to connect parallels from international double agents, deceiving stock traders, paranoid auditors, over active policemen, cunning terrorists and troubled poets just to explain that people sometimes lie and it's ok. Lots of dramatic filler without enough substance. He's like your favorite Jazz musician making a pop record. Understandably he has to make a living.

Instead you have to interpret what Gladwell is saying about talking to strangers through several examples.

  Gladwell is an entertaining author and I've read the majority of his books. This one infuriated me, and when I scrolled through the reviews, I noticed that other people feel the same. The chapters on Sandra Bland, Brock Turner, and Brock Turner's victim are so badly written. Brock Turner's case was boiled down to (in this book) a tragic event where both were too drunk to form consent. WHAT? Don't waste your time. Skip this one.

  Malcolm Gladwell has built his brand on a formula - take a handful of interesting stories, identify an uncommon thread across those, and call that thread a theory - even though there are many hundred stories in everyday life that prove otherwise.  In this lazy book, he doesn’t even pretend to be thorough.  Poorly researched, mediocre insights, and indefensible contentions.  While I am not sure, I think, he can do better.

  For those that have read Gladwell, you know he has a unique structure to his books. Chapters are almost their own mini thesis that somewhat loop together into his greater exploratory narrative. Like all Gladwell books, some chapters are dynamite and others are a little flat. Overall, more to like than not. The topics include why we are poor communicators and how challenging it is to understand one another as many of our preconceived notions of truth and identifying liars are wrong. Although I felt his conclusion was softer in this book than in others. When I finished, I didn't know quite what to think or really what he was trying to say. Left me wanting a bit more analysis.

  Just read this book, better- listen to the author's narration, if you are on a budget- get a library card, don't waste your time on long reviews and people's opinions- just read it. This is exactly the book about not rushing with judgement and be careful with all public opinions. In art there is a concept of ""negative space"", when what is not in our focus carries also, sometimes more important message. This is a book about the negative spaces. All books from this author are real joy for cerebral people.

  Really liked this book.  Love how MG weaves in stories about many recent events and provides background and details that are often overlooked or unknown to the general public.  Starts off with the Sandra Bland story and takes a look at how we often are not communicating, or not communicating what we THINK we are communicating.  Eye opening for everyone and took away lots of valuable ideas to use in business.

  I have read and enjoyed several of Gladwell's books but this one was a terrible disappointment. It's a disturbing recap of murders, suicide, and detailed descriptions of child molestation cases. I kept skipping ahead thinking it would surely get better but it never did. If you want to read a great Gladwell book skip this one and read Outliers.

  I really enjoy Malcolm Gladwell’s podcast, Revisionist History. I tried reading his book, Tipping Point, but for some reason his works are much more interesting to me when I listen to Gladwell himself, so I decided to download the audio book of Talking to Strangers. The only positive about this book is how it’s done. It’s been produced like a podcast with actual interviews, and re-enactments which make it a much more interesting listen. The good stops there. Gladwell goes on and on and on about why and how everyone misunderstands each other, but there is no application - no payoff - no “so this is how to better approach people.” It’s deeply unsatisfying. Also, I hated.. HATED the chapters on sexual assault. It was awful to listen to and made me sick to my stomach. He could have gotten the point across without it.Did not enjoy this book at all and do not recommend it. Listen to Revisionist History instead for free.

  Some critics panned this book.  One even claimed he didn't get the point.  I thought it was thought provoking, interesting, and convincing.  The research is impressive.  It all adds up to a cautionary tale against thinking that we're good at sizing up people we don't know.  The account of the decline in suicide rates when easy options were removed is valuable guidance for government policy.

  I am a huge Malcolm Gladwell fan and so was surprised (but not put off) by the many less than glowing reviews.  Now that I've read it, I have to say that it has not disappointed me in the least.  It is another really good book by Gladwell and I have to think that those people who thought otherwise might just be the ones who can't let go of their own notions that they are really good judges of the character of others.  It might just be that you have to have lived through prolonged deception and have thought yourself a fool afterwards to truly appreciate how good this book is!

  Don’t get me wrong, I love Malcolm Gladwell.  I read Outliers first, but when I bought this book I didn’t realize that he was giving weight to the brutal policing that is happening to African Americans.  All that to say, I appreciate not only his perspective, but the hard work and research he’s used to show that the mindset of policing in America is wrong.  He doesn’t say that the system is racist, but he does point out that it unproportionately affects African Americans.All that to say, this is good read to get a perspective on how systemic racism works and gives the police permission to terrorize Black Americans.

  I couldn't get past the author's opening thesis. Maybe I judged the book too early, but to examine the death of Sandra Bland as a result of ""not knowing how to talk to strangers"" is an insult. I highly recommend reading a small snippet from the book first to see if it's your cup of tea. It was not what I was expecting. I heard glowing remarks about this book, and so I bought it without really looking into it. Shame on me.

  It’s amazing how little we know about our own human nature and predispositions. This lack of self-awareness and awareness of others, of strangers, is increasingly important as we face a polarization in society and an inability to see each other more clearly or even at all. We need to learn how to talk to strangers because we are all strangers to someone. To everyone.

  Incredibly well researched argument on topics that I would typically only “make sense of” in a blur of confusion and emotions. That is to say, I don’t. Malcolm Gladwell is inspiring. His essay style writing on controversial topics is bold yet convincing. I was left thinking about the topics he mentioned for hours on end, which inevitably meant reading this book at a much slower pace. Would definitely recommend this read to anyone who is struggling to find their perspective and voice on a number of issues the way I am. First, how can I convince myself on a perspective. Then second, how can I convey my thoughts convincingly. I think both matters require a great amount of time and thought, both of which Malcolm has clearly mastered in this art piece.

  Malcolm Gladwell takes such a deep, well researched dive into our world and history to find the deepest truths to the human condition. His writing style is captivating and thought-provoking. From Adolf Hitler to Amanda Knox to Fidel Castro to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed to interactions with police, Malcolm Gladwell has truly discovered some hidden truths about Talking to Strangers and the importance of listening, trust (or ""default to truth""), and acceptance of the strange to help keep our human society intact.Reading this will hopefully help bolster your faith in humanity, I know it did mine.I have bought multiple copies for friends and to ensure this gem will be available if anyone needs to borrow it.

  Talking to Strangers doesn’t hold a candle to Tipping Point or Outliers, but there’s still those “aha!” moments throughout that keep you engaged.I can see how some of the other reviewers were frustrated or offended by his take on the Stanford case and Sandra Bland, but Gladwell’s perspectives have always been practical and this book is no different.I immediately started Know Ny Name by the Stanford rape victim and it’s been fascinating to read two very different perspectives on this case.

  I spend a great deal of time passively taking in “information”. Gladwell picks a subject that matters , discusses it clearly and understandably and without jargon, makes you re-examine your assumptions about subjects you had been exposed to in real time, had cataloged and put away in the back of your mind,  and start all over again to actually think more actively and deeply than you have been accustomed to of late.

  Like most of his books this is a well organized series of stories that starts with a tragedy, presents a couple puzzles, and proceeds to go about unraveling them to pose a possible answer. Easy to read stories that make the pint he wants and leaves us thinking about them well after we put the book down. And, how we interpret our intersections with strangers as well as how they interpret their interactions with us we learn can be as important as life and death.

  There are so many ways to misunderstand people -- and that is when you are speaking their language.  This book explores the deep cultural roots that impact how we see the world, and explains how local customs, professional training, responses to stress can all conspire to create grave misunderstandings.  This is a great book to read when meeting people from strange lands or strange neighborhoods.  Gladwell does a fantastic job using famous matings between different cultures, and the many, overconfidences that can cause even professionals at the CIA from correctly spotting liars.  This book would be helpful to anyone who is in customer service, aviation, diplomacy, legal fields and many more, where you have to understand, work with and straighten out people.

  Gladwell has touched on a crucial part of our superficial and distant society: how to deal with those strangers we meet every day. He shows, in astonishing detail, how utterly inept we are in recognizing people for who they truly are. Such blindness has led to uncounted misery and death. This book is a clarion call for us, as a people, to pay attention to our own biases and judgment about the strangers around us.

  He has maybe two major theses: 1. We really don't know what others are thinking, and 2. We tend to give people the benefit of the doubt.  We're therefore susceptible to being fooled or miscalculating the motives of others.  He presents some fascinating data over the next 2 or 3 hundred pages.  Entertaining, but not profound, pretty much on the level of his previous books.

  I couldn’t put this book down. It’s scary to think that people make assumptions about people at every level and their conclusions are rarely supported by empirical evidence. It’s as if fate is indeed determined by hunches and would just as easily be determined by the roll of a die. I, for one, will be so more aware of my predilection for trust, for assuming facial expressions match inner emotions and that I can predict another’s motivations. I will also no longer consider the cast of Friends as average actors!

  raport with strangers.  He did this only by describing the many ways we fail and the sometimes disastrous consequences.  I was hoping for more discussion of empathy, understanding, authenticity, being nonjudgmental, as well as how to connect with people from unfamiliar cultures.  The insight most enlightening for me was that, in most situations, we tend to assume the other person is being truthful unless confronted with obvious evidence to the contrary, and how this attitude is essential for society to function.

  There are a lot of reviews mad about some of the more controversial topics, and I really appreciate that about this book. Gladwell doesn't make sweeping judgments on some that the media condemns and I appreciate his willingness to look openly even if it is against narrative.

  A loose collection of stories without a strong theme. The book ends about halfway through the subject. Labelling a few behaviors and intertwining unrelated stories is not analysis and the result is reader regret over money spent. Gladwell needs to work a little harder next time.

  This book is amazing!  The book is written such that it feels as if the author is in the room talking to you instead of reading.  Anyone that is interested in becoming effective in communication with others should read this book.  I am so glad I purchased it and will definitely read more from this author in the future.

  From a journalist this is the gold standard of writing I believe. He formulates a very war point and backs it up with what he believes is evidence. Talking to strangers is really about empathy and how generally people are so bad at it that it produces a societal problem.
